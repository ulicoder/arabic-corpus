In 2010, women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in U.S., down from 37% in 1985, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. Analysts say the low numbers are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys. Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, theorizes that this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows like “Revenge of the Nerds” and “The Big Bang Theory.”
Why do you think more women and girls aren’t pursuing careers in computing and tech fields? Do you think the problem is that parents, teachers and society in general do not encourage girls to enter these fields?

O2 company produced a study that showed that “telephone” apps on smartphones—that is, using your phone to make actual phone calls—are only the fifth-most-used app among the general public. 75% of Millenials prefer texting to calling. RIT researchers in their study on calling vs. texting found that the participants do not like the small talk and the need for an immediate reply that characterise calling as opposed to texting.
How often do you make a phone call? How does this compare with your texting habits?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of phone calls? Text messages? Communicating over social media?
Ten years from now, do you think the number of phone calls made will be more, less or about the same as now? Explain.

Should tablet computers replace textbooks in schools?
Should tablet computers become the primary way students learn in class — for classwork, homework and educational games? Will this technology engage more students than old-fashioned teaching? Or do you feel that tablets will end up distracting students? Consider the following studies:
Singer and Alexander (2016) found that school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbooks.
A study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional textbooks.

Do people overuse air conditioning?
Do you ever find yourself cold in the middle of summer — in stores, offices, classrooms or even your own home? Address the following studies:
Murphy (2015) writes that being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores.
Hedge and Gaygen (2010) claim that the optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that.

How do you feel about the use of cellphones as educational tools — whether in or out of the classroom? How can you, as teachers, use them during lessons? As students, do you use cell phones for learning purposes? Do you agree that cell phones can distract from schoolwork?
In you essay, address the following studies:
1. According to the survey conducted by Tinder and Bohlander (2011), 95% of the students bring their phone to class every day, and 92% use their phone to text message during class time. The majority of the students also admitted they used their phones for browsing, sending pictures and accessing social networks during classes.
2. Lee, Kim, McDonough, Mendoza and Kim (2017) conducted an experiment in which students were divided into three groups: (1) cell phone usage allowed, (2) cell phone possession allowed but without usage, (3) cell phones removed. All participants attended a 20-minute lecture and were sent text messages during the lecture to mimic classroom distractions. After the lecture, all three groups took a multiple-choice test on the material they learned. The participants who had their cell phone taken away performed significantly better on the test than the two other groups.
