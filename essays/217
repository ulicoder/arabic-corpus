In the recent years, people start to use air conditioning almost all summer long, and some people even cannot stay inside without air conditioning, the reasons are several, maybe because the temperature is really high, so people just cannot handle it without air conditioning.
According to Murphy (2015), being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige, which means that if you are able to use conditioner, you are strong and from a higher society. Moreover, Murphy (2015) says that luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores, which again says that if you use air conditioning you are more prestigious.
However, Hedge and Gaygen (2010) claim that the optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius, and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that, in other words, in order to keep the workers productive, we need to keep the room temperature within the average, otherwise they will become less productive.
