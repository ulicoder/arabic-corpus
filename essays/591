My presentation was about the short story â€œThe Necklace", by Gue de Maupassant. Sabreen and I presented together, we were obliged to present the story through a presentation. In addition, we were needed to include a creative activity. I faced some difficulties while preparing the story and while presenting it.
Sabreen and I prepared the presentation, first: we read the story, and then we start to look for information about the author, after that we analyzed the story. It was active and easy to analyze the story, but we faced a few difficult words, but later we succeeded after we translated the difficult words.
In addition, we read it for few times to understand it better. It was excited to work with Sabreen she is a good presenter and serious, we were helping each other, both of us work hard and give the maximum, we put a lot of efforts. I think she was a good partner to work with, she helped me in some cases, we sit and worked together and help each other, I was really satisfied and comfortable to working with Sabreen.
It was important to teach a story in front of the class to know where are my mistakes, how to improve my education in front of the class. From my experience I was nervous and scared to teach, but later on when came the time to present I felt that this tension has disappeared when I started to teach. I prepared well but I felt I could do better; my voice was low, and some spelling mistakes. However, when we did the activity I was satisfied it was creating the students to join.
As a result, my goals to improve: first, I will work on myself in order to enhance my speech.
For conclusion, for the next time I should be aware more for these mistakes and to give all my efforts to teach the class without feeling nervous or scared. In addition, to be accustomed to have a high voice and to be confident in front of the class.
