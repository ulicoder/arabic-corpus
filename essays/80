Most students nowadays use bad words any words anywhere: school, home, street and even in public places.
I would like to talk about the topic in general because I haven't exposed to this situation in my school - which is primary school.
I think that students are used to say lots of bad word because of different reasons, one of which is communication. They are definitely exposed to the media like internet and tv without their parents' observation. They start using these bad words unconsciously.
