It is obvious that most computer technicians are men. The shortage of women in computer science is not secret, it has been a hot topic in recent years with numerous organizations and companies rallying to increase the number of women in jobs related to science.
Interest and aptitude in computer science courses is about equal for both genders in lower grades, by the time kids hit high school, make students take engineering, and computer science classes much larger percentage than female students. I think that the reason behind this is partially due to social barriers. Many women choose not to pursue computer science classes because they believe stereotypes about the kind of people who work in the field, and do not see themselves fitting in with those stereotypes. In this way, perceptions can shape career paths.
However, computing field can be lucrative and full of opportunities. Additionally, this science is going to be involved in everything in the future, so both men and women can join this field. I believe that more females will get their views on some of the commonly held believes that may be keeping them away from this field.
