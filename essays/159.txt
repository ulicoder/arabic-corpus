God created earth, and created the four seasons of the year. They are full of changes, feelings and associations that accompany them.
Personally, I am a calm female. I love calmness, romance, nature and green colors everywhere. I love to smell nature, to smell the dust and the green grass. To enjoy the beauty of the blossomed roses and smell their fragrance. Therefore, my favorite season is absolutely spring. Spring is the season of green nature, romance, rest and tranquility. I love to sit by myself for hours meditation the attractive beauty of this gorgeous season.
