Some teachers believe that imparting homeworks it might be important, since it help children memorize the material they have learnt at school, while some parents believe that homework is not that important, and students should rest and play after spending all the day studying.
Regarding my point of view as a mother, children on the one hand, should have daily homeworks. Thus, they might have the opportunity to practice, what they have learnt, individually. Besides, having homeworks after school might, help children build responsibility regarding their actions. For example, children are rewarded of their homeworks by earning grades. In addition, students might develop and improve their time management. Since students, at different school levels, struggle to manage their time, a homework after school would be the best decision to improve such skills.
On the other hand, as a teacher, I believe that homeworks should be given at elementary schools only, for letting children practice the basics of any taught material, while students, at high school levels, should not be given homeworks because of the bagrut examinations, for instance.
Finally, regarding my perspective, teachers and parents should look and the quality of homeworks given to the students and not the quantity.
