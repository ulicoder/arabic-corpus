I believe that kids should have enough time on playing and enjoying their daily life. This does not mean that kids are not learning, because they can learn and acquire many thing trough playing. Playtime, I think, makes kids knowing new thing in an interesting way, which they really love it.
Indeed, I encourage doing homework at school with teachers. This may be more effective than doing it at homes. teachers can explain themselves better than parents. In addition, not all parents can help their kids with their homework. Thus, will make kids feel depressed.
