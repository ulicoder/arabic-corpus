We all know that, in general, boys and girls are very different in their learning styles. There are many ways in classrooms could increase students achievement that should be considered. I think that single-gender schools would allow boys and girls to be ordered in away that is helpful to them for study and learn in a best ways.
There are many differences between boys and girls. The boys have physical differences in the way their brains works than girls because girls are more readers in literature than boys that many boys are hating to memorize any thing that they need to be focused on. Now in that case I agree with single-gender schools for both of girls/boys because when teacher or when boys and girls study separated they have to encourage each other to have a really good degrees, but if they were in the same school and in the same classroom, they will have many issues to deal with, like for example a relationships between girls and boys can effect on their study or the teacher can make more attention about some perfect girls or boys that they constantly participate in class and this things can effect on boys mostly because perfect students always are girls. So in my opinion they should have a single-gender schools because each gender deserves the better in their learning.
