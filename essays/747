Hawaii is a small island, quality and you can have a green natural.
In fact I love Hawaii. When someone ask me where you wants to live I sure myself will say Hawaii! It's not just because the quality also it's beautiful and make you feel better, you can be relax, take a breath, you can walk in the green trees.
It's an amazing place in the world. I think Hawaii a paradise in the earth, and I say that because many people told me about everything in it.
I like everything that can make me breath free and rest and Hawaii can do that.
In the future I will live there I thinking actually.
