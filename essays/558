Well I agree with the following statement due to many reason such as
that for me as a student I used to admire the teacher who respect his students and treat them well more than a teacher who used to know everything about his subject but never respected his students.
I also know that students respect and admire the person who respect them so teachers should respect student in order for students to respect them.
But I also think that a well knowledge in the subject being taught is as important as a good treatment, so I think teachers should focus on both of these elements for them to be well known and for their students to be educated with the subject.
A knowledgeable teacher is an important element in our education system because we are getting to a time that many ignorant people are teaching student and due to this fact many of us graduate from school with many wrong methods and material so we should focus on getting students with the right thing that they will need in their future.
At the end of it we should focus on both elements to graduate a new generation with more knowledge that the previous one.
