I agree that the young people enjoy life more than the older people.
The young people have a lot of energetic, powerfully and passionate and this is make and help them enjoying life more than the older ones.
On the one hand the youngers don't have a lot of responsibility like the older ones, for instance, the older ones may take a responsibility of their children and home and they are working to get money all of these reasons making them enjoying the life less. The youngers have a lot of options and more free time to do what they are interested in. For example, club, adventures, hobbies.
But in the other hand the older ones are financially independent and they can buy whatever they want. And they actually do not have to ask anybody for money or for permission to buy what they want. But young people need to depend on their parents for everything and they are generally not financially independent. And they also have other commitments. For instance, many young people attend college or university.
So sometime we can't compare or decide who are enjoying life more, everyone has his enjoyment.
