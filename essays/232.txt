In ten years from now telephone apps on smartphones will be used less than those days because the use of the texting will be more than ever.
People usually prefer texting rather than calling. People feel safer, they can take their time thinking about a suitable answer, rather than reply immediately without thinking.
Texting gives people the opportunity to avoid answering the annoying people which is a great deal for people who do not want to hurt the feelings of others.
