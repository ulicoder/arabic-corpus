The filter bubble is what the internet is hiding from you. Result from personalized searches what a website knows information base on your location or your search history. It gives us free service and costs us our information. I was kinda aware that the information on the website is targeted to our interests, such as Facebook or Instagram first asks us what we like to see or to follow and we choose what we are interesting for such as fashion or celebrities etc..
Sometimes I am okay with it because it did not shows me crimes or wars but, in the other hand it is frustrating me when I miss posts of my friends or family because I am interested of and what they share.
In my opinion I would like to see besides my friends posts, the good things that's happening in the world, I would like to see positive stuff. The online search and the news services should work harder to publish more posts that effect us in the right wayÂ  and leads us to think positively, not publishing about killing or motivate us in a negative way.
