I think that single-sex schools is not a good idea for both boys and girls. As a parent, I prefer my children to study in mixed-gender classrooms for many reasons.
Firstly, students will one day live and work side by side with members of the opposite sex. So, learning pupils in a single-sex schools will limit them to work cooperatively and co-exist successfully.
Secondly, I believe that boys and girls who study in the same class will compete more in dominated subjects like math and English. Moreover, pupils will be more confident and open-minded.
Above all, I think as a teacher that a mixed-gender classroom is more comfortable than a single-sex.
