It is common that young people enjoy their life more than older people do, in other words, young people know how and where to spend their time, so they will get the maximum fun and entertainment.
In my opinion, that statement is right, because first of all, young people have a full health most of the time, so they can do different types of activities such as climbing, camping and running, but older people cannot do most of that activities because they do not have health for it.
Another reason why young people enjoy their life more is that they do not have a lot of commitments as older people do, they do not have a house, they are not responsible about anybody but themselves, while older people have a job, a house to keep and maybe kids to take care of.
Moreover, young people do not feel shy doing what they want as older once do, they can do whatever they want without caring to what others are going to say and think about them, but older people care almost for everybody's opinion about them, because they are grown older and they are responsible about every act they make.
But, we cannot say that older people do not enjoy their time at all, we can find old people which are enjoying their time even better and more than young people, it depends on the person's own thoughts.
We can conclude by saying that having fun and enjoying your time is a personal choice, you decide to enjoy your time no matter in which age you are, but in general, try to enjoy your life as much as you can while you still in a young age, and while you have all the options we mentioned above.
