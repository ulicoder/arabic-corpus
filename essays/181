There is no question that air conditioning is the most important invention of the century. Humankind need it everywhere and there are no substitutions which can replace it. However, I find myself cold in the middle of summer, personally I can't take the AC more than half an hour. I find myself feeling so cold and not comfortable.
According to Murphy (2015) states that being able to make people feel cold in the summer is a sign of power and high prestige. Because luxury stores and fantasy stores usually maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores. Which means that only rich people can afford staying at stores with AC, unlike regular and poor people, who often went to mass-market stores to shop.
However, another scholars Hedge and Gaygen (2010) claim that optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less active, productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that.
In another words, people at their work or school or anywhere else are less active and productive because people make more mistakes in a room temperature is lower than the regular. So, we can conclude that people need the AC, even if they feel cold in the summer.
