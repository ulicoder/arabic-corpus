Summer vacation is necessary for children, teachers, students plus any one who works or learn in an eduction organization. In summer vacation I have many things to do as a teacher. First, I take a break from school lessons. Second, I travel to the country I like and spend a great time there. Third, I spend much more time with my family, and finally I can be satisfied plus relaxed from any pressure in these two months. In addition I produce myself for the next school year to clarify, I place what to teach my students, this is another reason to love the summer vacation and I think that it must be more than two months.
Moving on to that children as well love the summer vacation holiday, they look forward to it with great anticipation. To shorten the holiday would make restful, remove their incentive to work during the term and most importantly, take away one of the increasingly fewer opportunities to children to just relax and play.
Despite all of this not all children love summer holidays, some of them hate the change in routine or they their home situations are not good or they just enjoy being at school with their friends during the day.
In conclusion, I see that the length of summer vacations must be longer for at least three months.
