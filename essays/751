Last year I went school trip with my friend to Akko.
When we arrived we saw the beautiful sea, and we rode in the ship we saw the fish, we played near the sea and took some pictures.
In the way back we went to Big we eat hamburger and we bought the purposes, but the weather was cloudy and not nice. And in the way to home it start raining. It was a bad luck to me but in finally we backed home in safety.
