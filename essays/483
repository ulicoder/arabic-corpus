Many claimed that the young people enjoy life more than older people do, in my opinion, that true and that for many reasons.
At first, young people energy are enough to enjoy life more than older people do, and that because, and that because young people' passion are different from the old people, the old people have already experienced the good and the bad that life has to offer them, if young people can learn from their experiences; they can handle difficult situations in their life with ease. But with time comes the generation gap also. People with growing age canâ€™t do things which the young people can do without getting tired or catching their breath.
In addition, to going out and have fun with friends, young people have fewer responsibilities than older people. We need money to buy a house, rent a car, and pay up for insurance. Our elders take care of these responsibilities. Young people are more involved in building their career and they care less about any of these issues, and that make the Young people more dependent on their life,
And also young people do not have any burden for them, and thus lead enjoys life more than older people.
Finally, young people have less health related issues. Old people body is weak and less stamina. Older people are exposition to suffer to more disease; Young people can also suffer from these problems. However, the probability of these health issues grips the young people is quite less so Concerns regarding the body or sickness are not the significant problems for young people.
So being young gives you the ability to enjoy on your life more so take the chance and live your life healthy and happy.
