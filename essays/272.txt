Ten years from now, I think the number of phone calls made will be the same as now, because part of people don't feel comfortable while they are speaking on the phone, and the other part they feel more comfortable while texting more than talking on the phone.
In some cases the phone call is better more than a texting, such as, in urgent situations, when the person wants a quick response about something. Making call phone is the perfect choice to make. In the other hand texting sometimes it takes a while until the person who needs the respond to receive a respond from the other person who he/she is texting.
Some find or believe that texting is their comfort zone because they can text and take their time while responding the other person, in contrast while they are in phone call they feel like someone is watching them and they can't say all what they want to say, therefore they intend to respond in short answers and to stay at a safe side.
