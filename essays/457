No one forgets a good teacher, itâ€™s a strong title... When you read it when you say it, you will feel that... Because we really can not forget our specific teachers, that gave us a good quality, a good teaching and a good memories.
You will not ever forget the person that how gave you the first book to read it in your life, you will not forget the human that he told to you how to spend your time perfectly besides tour books besides your ideas besides your mine and your words, how you can forget the human that he said to you in some time when you failed in your lesson: "hey you stand up and be strong dare to dare to dare to try to achieve and to get your grads again stand firm", you will not ever "ever" forget that person that he walked the whole way with you, what I mean in the whole way "the specific and the first steps for you in any level in your studying".
A good teacher how gave you a chance in the life to walk in the soldier road step by step to get your goals without stress.
The good teacher how was believing in you... And he was sure from your success in your life... For example my dear teacher (Samah)... He started with me from my first class until now! She asked about me, she asked about my studying and my life she was a teacher and a mom, she was also a good friend for the me... No for us!
In shortly when I look for the another hand I want thank her for every thing until now, and I want to say for you and for her, the good teacher simply must to have like you.
