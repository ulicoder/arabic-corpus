At schools there is a lot of competing students who try to gain the higher grades and more popularity. Mixed gender schools focus on giving the best education for boys while less attention for girls.
So, girls tend to compete and try their best to have teachers attention by prove and enhance their character. I think that single-gender school is not a good idea and by this method girls will not have the the spirit of competition and lose their focus on other unbenefit things that might not be good.
Mixed gender schools create a healthy educational environment where boys and girls compete, try and learn. Also students at those schools receive more access to diversity because they are not look alike so their personal progress will get better.
The equality gap on societies will diminish and no one receive any special treatment because they are a boy or a girl. The character on the society for the students will be more interacting and we will prepare them for a world that is mixed. Girls can receive great benefits during their life and while choosing their career because of the opportunities that mixed gender schools provide.
