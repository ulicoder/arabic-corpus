The article about "Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job" is very interesting because it made me realize a new way of using the Instagram. The second article "Inside The World Of Teenagers With Millions Of Followers" has a point of view but the writer writes in her perspective of things, e.g.: Danielle Cohn is one of those teenage curiosities that most of us old enough to vote (have you registered yet?), who said so? "most of us". The third article "How Influencers Build Instagram Followings" is about an influencer woman called Phoebe McPherson and her life career. In my opinion the first article is the most researched and presenting the best evidence because it consist a personal experiences and also pictures to support the article.
