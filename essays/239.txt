Tablet computers are the new suggestion that some researchers say should be integrated to schools and should replace textbooks: the old-fashioned teaching. But if we think deeply about this idea we will find several disadvantages that it grasps.
Textbooks have been used for decades in schools and the teachers and every educator cannot deny that this way of teaching led to much successful results and high achievements. Students have been used to this method of teaching and they have never showed a disagreement to it as Singer and Alexander (2016) found that "school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbooks".
Tablets will lead to less achievements and the student's grades will become lower because tablets could distract the students a lot, while using them many students might use them from playing games or looking for football news or for chatting with others. Tablet will interrupt the teaching, even thought they're an enjoyable tool, where the aim of the lessons to teach the students and educate them, and they're not for entertaining the students.
In addition to the disadvantage, that where mentions, tablets also are dangerous for the brains, and the eyes, because of the amount of radiation that those tablets grasp, that causes cancer and many other damages.
Surprisingly, in other study by Houghton, Miffing Harcourt (2011) showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one years despite this fact, the support to the idea of replacing textbooks with tablet should not be applied in schools.
