Yes, I agree with this statement. teachers should relate in a good way with the students because it affects on their behavior in class and in their studying.
A lot of teachers or people's thought that the most important thing in school is to give the material to the students no matter in which way, because if they do not understand the material they will not get high degrees.
But I think that the way teacher behave in class with the students is more important, since if the students do not like the teacher's way and he do not respect them, the students will not concentrate in the lesson, will hate the lesson, also will dislike the subject itself, and that is a bad result. And even if this teacher gives the students all the material they have to know and explain to them they will not feel good about this subject.
Teacher who behaves in a nice way with the students, respect them, try to help them in everything they need, also if there is a personal problem he cares for it, students will like this teacher's lesson more, will be waiting tell this lesson starts, respect the teacher more, like the subject and the most important thing that they will understand more.
Schools' goal is to graduate excellent students, and to get that goal they have to find the good ways to teach and educate them and make them satisfied of themselves and the knowledge they acquired.
