I have always known that I would get to this stage in my life, where I will get back to a high institute and complete my studies for my second degree.
It may have taken much longer than it should have, but I believe that time is not an issue once you make your decision and start on your journey in a new academic year and a new adventure.
I have started my studies for the second degree in education many years ago, and for some personal reasons I did not complete my studies. This has always been a black spot in my past and I have never liked to really talk and discuss this issue with others. It felt like failure and at the moment, I do not want to dwell on this failure. I need to have a change and it is important for me to step out of my comfort zone, challenge my self and eventually complete my studies.
I believe that this decision will transfer the way I do and see things in a positive way. It will give me the opportunity to do things different and in a more successful way. It will give me the change to reflect on the things that I have been doing in order to assess and reassess them. I hope that all my expectation will come true. Thus year is definitely going to be the push I need to myself and to my pupils.
