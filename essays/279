This paper discusses the using of tablet computers and textbooks in schools based on several studies.
Although tablet computers may be more enjoyable than textbooks, but students mostly learn better by textbooks. In this regard, Singer and Alexander (2016) found that school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbooks. Namely, printed textbooks are more effective than tablet computers for students' learning.
Whereas others believe that students learn better and obtain higher grades by learning with tablet computers. Accordingly, a study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional books. Mainly, Harcourt presents the benefit of iPads than printed textbooks by showing students' math scores.
However, this study may be rejected since it focuses only on math scores which is not considered to be a reflection of all the topic. Therefore, using tablet textbooks may be more enjoyable than old-fashioned teaching, but it is not necessary to be more useful than books.
