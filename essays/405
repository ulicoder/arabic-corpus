These three articles were my favorite, all of them discussed a subject I can't consider a day well spent of my life withouht logging in toÂ  Instagram. The three articles are very intersting, full of new rich information that stabilized in my mind. The three articles are full of information but the article that attracted my attention is "Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job". It helped me learn the Instagram uses that I didn't know however I use Instagram a long time ago. In addition it talked about things that happened in the real life and how the famous people earn money from their followers.
The best evidence in this article is in this article because it talked about a personal experience.
