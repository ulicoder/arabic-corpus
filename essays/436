All the articles are interesting and attract the reader especially the young readers because it talks about a topic and something that we use daily in our lives. The most interesting article for me was "How Influencers Build Instagram Followings" because it's present the difficulties that the influencers faced because the followers always want stories as he said but sometimes you are not in the mood or you can't but you should do it, different ideas that people think about the influencers on Instagram, the good things that we can use the Instagram for and the "dirty" things, use the Instagram for work in addition how to help herself and the others by being influencer that have a huge followers on Instagram.
I think that this article has the best evidence because it based on quotes and interview.
