Despite of the different points of view regard the necessity of homeworks, they are a part of the studying process. Accordingly, as any other thing, homeworks have advantages and disadvantages, which make it a controversial topic.
Accordingly, this paper presents some aspects of both advantages and disadvantages. Several people believe that homeworks are necessary and highly needed for both teachers and students. Since that students need homeworks for more practicing which on its turn helps them understand the material better.
Some teachers claim that doing homeworks motivates the students to participate during the lesson. The fact that doing homeworks helps the students understand the material better and so to feel it more familiar and relevant for them, might increase their encouragement to participate in the lesson and be an active part of it which is important for the effectiveness of the learning process.
Whereas others might believe that kids should rest and play after spending all day studying. Which is also important for them in order to express themselves and free themselves from the pressures that they have in their lives.
However, the fact that students have many other things to do than their homeworks does not cancel the importance of homeworks as a reviewing tool for the material that they learn which helps them to mster and understand the topic better.
Therefore, I believe that teachers have to make a balance between homeworks and the students' needs and lives with taking into consideration that students also have to spend a few time doing other things than studying.
