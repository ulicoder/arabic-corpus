My school newspaper asked readers to write about their goals for the future and I want to write about my goals in my life.
My goals are to be a successful woman that has a good job also to be a grateful wife and mother that knows how to clean and cook in order to my kids.
My goals are very important for me because when I achieve these goals, I become a woman that has self-confidence and thankful for everything. I have to read and study very hard in order to succeed in my exams.
I hope that everyone can a achieve his goals and to be a successful human being in the future.
