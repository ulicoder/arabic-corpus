We can notice that women and girls don't enter to pursuing careers in computing fields. Analysts say that the low numbers are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys.
The parents don't encourage their daughters to go to that field, because they said to their daughters, you will be mothers in the future and that job doesn't fitting you. So, they advise them to go to learn to be as teachers.
Leaving this field for men, leads to rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as a white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV.
