Smartphones have become a huge part of our lives. Although the aim of inventing smartphones was to make human beings life easier and faster in terms of communication, people chose the opposite way. In other words, many people especially nowadays generation prefer texting to calling: thus they look at this matter from a different point of view. While adults and old people prefer calling to texting, in the sense that making a call is the quickest way and one can easily convey his message directly to receiver, teenagers believe that texting takes less time, and there is no need for an immediate reply.
In spite of the differences between the generation I believe that each way can be used in certain and different situations. It is true that calling is considered the swiftest way sometimes texting is the better option.
