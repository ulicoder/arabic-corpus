I disagree with the following statement due to many reasons:
That older people have more experience than young people, they've been through rough times that taught them how to deal with life and increased their capability to make the right decision.
Older people appreciate life more than young generation, that’s why they appreciate the time they have, and takes advantages of it, because they came to the conclusion that they won't live forever and that gave them a motivation to enjoy life more.
Older people worked so hard in their life and now they know that it's time to appreciate what they have (family and so on).
Older people stopped taking decision without thinking and that helped him not take a wrong decision that could change their life forever.
Many of them built a family that changed their life in many aspects, Family that could make them enjoy life more, gave them a reason to live and smile while young people are still trying to find their right path in life.
Elder people understood that youth is not everything that the things they would've killed someone for in their youth now looks so stupid.
Life is not only about being young, as humans we seek help from our Elders because we know they've been through things that could help us in our life, they may have less days left to live and less power to enjoy life but that won't let most of them to give up on life because they are strong and they are fighters.
So I don’t think we can judge who enjoys life more due to physical aspects we should dig dipper in order to find the right answer.
