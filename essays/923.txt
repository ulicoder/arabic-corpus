There are many ways to learn a foreign language. In my opinion, the most effective ways are, going to live in a country where the language is spoken, taking lessons as part of a class, and studying on your own.
The way I see it, going to live in a country, where the language is spoken, is a more effective way and help us, as learners to live the language and use it in the original source. This option gives us listening, speaking, hearing, understanding, and using this language effectivly and correctly. More over, living there led you combing the cultur becaus in my opinion, the language is culture. Unfortunately, I do not have enough money to live the experience, and in the top of that, I cant leave my family (husband and the children).
Taking lessons as part of a class is a second chance for me a useful way to learn. Sharing and learing materials, with others, help us learn in a fun and productive way. I beleive that the class is a small socity - interactive and taking part our experiances and feeling togather. I personally like this way because all the students motivate, support and encourge each other. However, this way takes time and money.
The last choice is studing on my own. We (as mothers and teachers) do not have the time to go out and study for along time. I personally, cant be away from my house more than one day. In addition, I teach at elementry school five days aweek. As a result, the best way is studing at home with my self, in front of my computer or reading books. From my experiment, it is a useful and effecitve way. When I have free time at home I do it with enjoyment. But I have a problem, I am a social person and cant stay alone for along time and sometimes I get tired quickly - working in the computer. On other hand, it needs a quiet calm place - not a big full house.
In conclusion, it does not matter the ways, but the important thing is to look for ways help us devoloping ourselves.
