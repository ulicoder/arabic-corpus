Young and older people enjoy life differently as far as I am concerned. It is not necessary that young people can enjoy their life and older people can not. In many cases older people enjoy their life in a better way than younger people. In this essay I will discuss why age is not very important to enjoy your life.
Of course young people have more opportunities in having this great time. Being energetic mean you can do a lot of things during the day. Young people can go to work, do sport activities, play with children and spend time with their friends, and all that in one day. Therefore, they are able to spend their day doing so many things but does it mean that they are enjoying life? It's not necessary, working and doing so many things may effect your health problem.
Yet older people don’t have more opportunities in doing some of the activities that younger people do, but they can still do what they want to do. Older people usually don’t look for something that is childish, they look for something more their age and that they are able to do. For example, older people would just sit together and have a good conversation with each other unlike young people they would choose to play soccer or basketball which means they don’t have the time to speak to each other. Another thing some older people would do for their free time they would play a card game and a board game which helps them to use their brain unlike young people it is difficult to see them play those kinds of games, you would see them play on their phone or on the laptop.
Therefore, I think age is not everything to having fun. You can be at any age and still have fun it only depends on the person that is trying to have fun.
