The "filter bubble" is a result of a personalized search which websites algorithm selectively guess what information a user want to see based on the user's search history.
In another words, it guess the information or the news that the user is going to look for, by depending on his search history or location or past click. Users become separated from information that disagrees with their view points and thoughts.
Filter bubble potentially harmful to both individual and society, for example, after a while for seeing and searching on an issue or a point of view  that the user agree with, he is going to feel that he is correct, and then he's views are strengthened. This means that when he see a comment or other point of view that  disagree with his one, he will not accept or pay attention, so he is less likely to agree with others, or even talk to others.
Filter bubble made me think about the bubble that I have created for myself.
