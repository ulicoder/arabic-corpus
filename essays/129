The number of students in a class affects how well teachers can teach and students can learn. It is hard for us as teachers to control large classes, it is very tiring both for the teacher and the students. The teacher cannot reach every student's and make sure that he has got the message properly. It is hard for the teacher to match the level of the material to the different needs of the students. On the other hand, the student will feel lost and confused. Large classes are usually noisy, the excellent students follow the teacher, while the others cannot have a direct relationship with the teacher and therefore they feel lost.
the ideal size for a school class is about 15-20 students. According to my experience, the quality of the learning is different, the grades are higher and the overall atmosphere in the classroom is much better when the size of the class is smaller.
