There are in all the schools of the Arabian society a fast food restaurants, and a big part of the pupils eat from these restaurants.
I am a school student and I agree with the following suggestion, because I see that these restaurants are not healthy for the pupils, because all the menu of the food are fast food (junk food) not like the healthy food that we can bring from home.
If the fast food restaurants has been banned in the vicinity of schools, I think that all the pupils will eat a healthy food from home and their life will be tall and better than before, and all the pupils can use the money that they was pay for the fast food restaurants in other good things.
