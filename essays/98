Studying at a single-sex schools may has many positive points to be mentioned.
In the recent decade, this type of schools is highly recommended more than regular schools, which have both sexes.
First of all, for girls, it would be books which didn't have a male bias, so this will be a benefit to the feminists girls.
Second, girls become more confident when they are learning only with the same sex. That's a good reason for the boys who are attempting to attract girls and properly girls will not be under the dominant of boys ever than before.
From boy's point of view, they will not be as comfortable as when they study with their same sex. Besides, working in groups, peer and cooperative work may decrease the percentage of doing well on a project.
The next, boys become more focused during the class when it is not related to a mixed schools. Since that girls aren't make a huge effort to stand for an hour in front of a mirror to be nice and to attract boys. That's will help students to concentrate just with a teacher and materials.
