Teaching process is a positive relationship between teachers and students. Students learn from teachers. They get knowledge and information, and so do teachers. They learn from their students. They get benefit from them by getting experience, but, they will learn more by being evaluated by them. I totally agree about evaluating teachers by their students. I believe that students are the mirror of their teachers. If we want to know how the teacher teaches his lessons, we should exam and ask his students. Indeed, it's the best way for getting improved. No one is perfect. People make mistakes or miss things. That's why it's great to see what the students think about their teacher and write down positive and negative comments. Feedback always welcome.
