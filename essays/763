The school has suggested that fast food restaurants should be banned in schools. Those restaurants contain so much unhealthy food, but the majority of students eat it even if they don’t like it just because they are hungry. Some students agree that those restaurants should be banned. They said they got sick because it is unhealthy food and it is not clean.
Other students disagree. They say they should not be banned because they get so hungry on lunch break and they didn’t have time to pack their lunch in the morning and they only have lunch money.
My opinion on this is that fast food restaurants should be banned and replaced with healthy food and clean restaurants. So nobody can get sick from unclean food or get hungry.
