I have been a teacher for forty years. One of the difficulties that I am facing is the large number of students in my classes. I teach thirty students in each class. I feel so sorry for my student since I am not able to reach each one of them, they have so many things to share and many questions to ask and I am so limited because I cannot answer each one of them. Actually it is impossible to be the effective teacher with such a large number of students. There should be twenty students in each class. By this way I am as a teacher can fulfill my objectives and do so many different activities. My classes will be more attractive, significant and effective to the students.
