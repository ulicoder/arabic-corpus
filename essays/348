I think that single-sex schools are not good idea. Girls should learn in mixed schools, school that has girls and boys. It's important for the social relationship between the two genders. If we teach our girls and boys from the earlier ages that between both of them there is friendship, it will be better for future for different reasons. Such as, after school girls will work in different places. These places will have workers who are men. Because of that, they have to deal with each other. However, if they didn't be part of mixed school, it will be difficult for the girls, to know how to deal with such issues. Moreover, every signal will considered by them as abuse, which not correct.
In addition, girls who learn in mixed school will try the feeling of love. Felling with live with someone isn't bad, it's natural need that they have to try it. However, imagine the girls who didn't try it will be hard for them in the future to distinguish between her feeling toward that man. Moreover, when the girls and the boys in the same school and class, that develop kind of competition between these two genders.
In order, for each one of the to show that he or she is better and has higher abilities from the other, these kind of competitions are essential for girls' development, and they will achieve more in their academic, to improve for the boys that they can do it.
