Personally, I think that single-sex schools are not a good idea, because the real essence of the whole process of teaching is a matter of social interaction between human beings. Social interaction between students in the class has a great impact on the process of learning. Mixed-sex schools provide opportunities for the students to learn different things about each other; they share their unique experiences together. In addition mixed-sex schools encourages students to communicate more and it prepares them for social life.
In conclusion, it is more important for us to prepare our own children for real life rather than to focus on teaching material.
