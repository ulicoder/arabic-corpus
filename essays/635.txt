First of all, my colleague and I were more able to produce perfect presentation more than that we have made, I can say in other words that we had many strengths and at the same time weaknesses for example: our collaboration to make very clear and coherent ideas were the best, on the other hand, I felt somehow uncomfortable when I was speaking in front of the class since I was nervous without knowing the reason overall we enjoyed working as a team, especially when we have shared our ideas and knowledge.
In addition to what I said before, it was a very meaningful experience because of the collaboration that we had, and one of the main things that my colleague and I didn't well was the difficulty to arrange our time in order to work on the presentation furthermore we didn't make enjoyment activity to guarantee the understanding of the audience.
To sum up, it's beneficial to work with teamwork, this thing as I mentioned before a bit hard because of the time arrangement, but it makes me acquiring skills to handle the difficulties well more than this time, but overall I'm satisfied with the presentation.
