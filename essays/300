Some people prefer phone calls to text messages. While others may prefer communicated over social media. Although texting and social media apps are in fashion, still they lack some important communication skills that a phone call is more likely to have. So, in this paper I discuss how phone calls are better and could offer more natural features to the conversation than text messages do.
Phone calls give a person the opportunity to sense feeling more than text messages do. Text messages might be fake sometimes. For example, you might think that a person is happy just because they tell you they are "fine", while they are hiding their sadness. Whereas, during a phone call you can hear their voice and figure it out.
