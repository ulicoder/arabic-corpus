I think this process is very important and fundamental for both teachers and students. it is essential that learners express their thoughts and feelings about their tutors. But, they need to learn how to do it, for example, they need to evaluate their teachers respectfully and objectively. They can critic their teachers and express their thoughts by being honest to the aim of the evaluation. On the other hand, evaluation is important for teachers in order for them to know what positive and negative aspects they have. What are they strength and weak sides in their teaching. It is very important that such evaluations are done honestly and objectively without causing any personal harm of any of the parties. It should be pointed out to both sides that these evaluation are done to get the benefit and the good, in order to be able to improve.
