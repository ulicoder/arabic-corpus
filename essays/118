I don't have a least favorite season. Instead, I have least favorite and most favorite and just plain favorite aspects of all 4 seasons. In the summer, I love the warmth. I hate the heat. I appreciate being able to do stuff outside.
In the winter, I love the cool. I hate the cold. I appreciate the beauty of the rain and snow.
In the spring, I appreciate the beauty of the green grass and flowers. In the autumn, I love the fall colors. I hate all of the leaves on the ground that need to be raked up.
