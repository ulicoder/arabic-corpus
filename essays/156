Teachers teachers and parents like the summer vacation and wait for it eagerly. Personally, I think that stretching the vacation for July and August is too long. First, as a teacher and second as a mother.
As a teacher I notice that when students come back from the two-months vacation, they feel lost. We as teachers spend at least one full month teaching them and reviewing the last materials with them. It is also very difficult to bring them back to the learning environment and concentration after a long time of just playing and having fun without being restricted to any rules. As a mother, I also get tired from the long vacation. As my kids need a huge effort from me and I must fulfil their needs. Moreover, I feel that kids or students also feel bored day after day and need something to fill their free time.
