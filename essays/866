The tech industry is booming, and people are flocking to make a career in the digital work force. Technology companies diversity problem in their work these kind of companies pinpoint the factors that keep women or girls away from studying pursuing careers in computing (computer science).
In my point of view, both genders and females are equally talented in logic, but we can touch this problem is parents treated them differently. Boys were given computers more often than girls. This issue grows with them to have a large influence on students decision to study computer science.
Males are often more aware of the fact that learning programming affirm success to help and build confidence.
However collaboration are important to women when selecting careers, they may feel isolation until more women. Women need role models, and this gap is being addressed by programs like Girls Who Code as well as encouragement to position them to study technical disciplines in college, attracting women to technology is the first step toward developing women in computing and tech field. We can touch that early intervention and education will being to close the gap between women and men in computing, in these days parents change their way to increase likelihood that they purse additional computing courses and degrees.
