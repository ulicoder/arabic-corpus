A good teacher believes in her / his students even when they don't believe in themselves .
Being a teacher is a huge responsibility with many obstacles and there are many teachers who loves to take this challenge.
As we know building up your character depends on the nurture that you acquired in your family and the motivations from the teachers. There are many teachers who works hard on order to support their students to accomplishing their dream, they give them the opportunity to feel that they are good people and they will have a brightening future.
This motivation let the students feel that their teachers believe in their abilities.
Unfortunately our society lacks this kind of teachers, today there are many students who suffers from their teachers's behaviors, they just passing the materials, correcting the exams and donâ€™t take into account what their students feels about their lessons, when I was on the seventh grade, I had a problem with my history teacher. He told me all the time that you will never succeed in this material, I really lost hope and found myself on a closed way, and I grew up with this bad thinking .
In order to build up a successful society, we have to believe in our students abilities, we must be able to motivate the students to think to read to work hard in order to reach their dreams it's not enough to teach the students how to strengthen their memories, how to solve formula, and how to sum up an essays, we have to take into account that in order to believe in your self we as a teachers must support our students and fill their mind with the idea that no stars is far out of reach and we all have the ability to make a change in the society and in the world as a whole.
