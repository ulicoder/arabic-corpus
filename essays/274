According to the recent years, the number of the girls students in the single-sex schools have been arised.
Many people including teachers, students, and parents believe that girls performance in single-sex schools perform better than mixed schools. Further, these people claim that girls in single-sex schools learn better, and pay more attention without having boys in the classroom. Since boys can make a noise or problems or even they can effect the girls' performance.
Whereas others believe that boys don't have that essential affect on the girls' performance. Hence, girls who are interesting in learning they pay attention and try their maximum in order to perform perfectly as much as they can regardless the existence of the boys.
Moreover, this group of people believe that the bad effect of competing girls with boys in the same school is only an excuse for those girls for their ineffective performance.
However, I believe that competing girls and boys in the same school can be useful for both in terms of communicating with the other gender and enhancing their social skills beside their educational.
