Starting school early is a preferable choice for me as a teacher, student and a parent. I taught for more than ten years; I found that the first four lessons, from eight till eleven o'clock, are more useful and efficient for pupils. They are more focused, relaxed and motivated.
Moreover, a later start causes a later end. If we start late, it means that we will finish late and that is going to kill our rest of day time. We will become night creatures.
