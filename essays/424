The first article talks about a women who have been tried the korean skin care routine for a month and she was uploading pics weekly in this article she shows us her attitude from this routine and it also like a review for the audience, that she tries a product and tell us about it...
The tone in this article is "informal" because it doesn't talk about formal matters like science or anything else.
The audience is the people who love and interested with the beauty care which is clearly the women.
The second article talks about some informations and statistics about the make up in general, there is no one who tried something and want to tell us about it so the tone here is "formal".
The audience are the women and the men and all who interested in this stuffs.
