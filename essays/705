Nowadays, many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center. As a result there is a growing concern about the influence of this issue.
Firstly, the idea of banning cars from entering the city center will decrease the traffic in the streets. Furthermore, lots of cars especially in city center cause lots of accidents and damage. Some times this accidents cause death.
Secondly, cars cause pollution and very bad noise. Moreover, banning cars from entering the city center will decrease the damage of natural resources like oil, because cars consume a lot of petrol.
Eventually, cars cause a lot of harm and a lot of damage to nature and humans. So I strongly support with this decision of banning the cars from entering the center of the city.
