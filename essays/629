First of all it was my pleasure to do this presentation with Lama, the beginning was a little bit hard because I didn't have an idea how to explain a literature story to the others and as you know because of the delay of the dates of the presentation so we didn’t have enough time to do this job as well as.
Even though I didn’t like some of the things we've done,for example to copy from the internet and we explained that to you it was out of our control because of the lack of time, both of us work hard and we didn’t have a time also to schedule a date to set together and to prepare an excellent plan to our presentation because both of us work late into the night. But in the other hand we were diving head first into this work to make the best.
So I will talk about some improvements I will do if really I have a time, like to practice how to present, I think it was good my voice was loud but I didn’t have in some sense a strong control to control the students even though it's not my problem but I need to learn the way how can I improve that, so in the next time I will practice observing myself because it`s more essential the practice of watching ourselves...
And about the story it was a nice story and I felt that it explains the real, sometimes we heard a similar stories that happen in that wa, and it wasn`t hard but we faced some difficulties in the meaning of the sentences , and also I liked the part of the short film that`s make the students understand exactly what the story is talking about and because of that I thought it was necessary to show them this part of presentation. And about some of the character I think it explained well.
So in the next time I will look for these difficulties to improve them more
