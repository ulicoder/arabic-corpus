There are different studies and researches which talk and present the issue of e-books and paper books. Each one consider several views of advantages and disadvantages of both. For instance, PWC Consulting (2019) found that in 2018, e-books sales were higher than print books sales in US and UK. Personally, I agree that e-book are more beneficial for the environment, we save papers and keep the nature clean, and save more and more trees so we can keep the air cleaner. There are more people nowadays enjoy reading e-books than paper ones, this can be for several reasons such as the animations e-books have. Not to forget we are living in a world of technology, so people are more attached to computers and media, I think that will be fundamental reason why people are becoming more attracted to e-books. Still, on the other hand another study was conducted by Helm, Ligon, and Van Riper (2018), participating US College students preferred paper books of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided. Personally, I agree more with this study for several reasons. First, it makes me feel more satisfied and convenient when I am holding a book in my hands. It makes me feel more relaxed, and very close to the text I am reading. Second, reading paper books, gives such a pleasure looking at the book itself and the images in includes. It also can be more useful reading grammatically correct language. In conclusion, we may say that both studies can be reliable from several points of view, and each individual can choose.
