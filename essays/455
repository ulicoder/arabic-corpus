Good teachers know how to bring out the best in their students.
Everyone wants to success in their lives. That's why we go to school, college and get educated so we would grant to have a better future and a successful job, we try so hard to achieve our dreams but too many difficulties will surprise us and stand in front of our faces so we have to face it and to fight it, being a students cause them to face hard times, pressure and failure, but that shouldnâ€™t stop them so they need someone to encourage them.
The teachers has big importance at affecting on their students minds and thoughts, the teachers way of teaching and who their students receive it, that's what will cause them success, when the teachers respect their students and let them be their selves the students will respect them back and feel comfortable and confident about them selves, if the teachers show their students that they care about their future and they want them to success, therefore get high grades the students will start believing in their skills, they will start thinking positively and then everything will follows, they will feel excited to try and to give more by actions not just words.
When the teachers look at their students with passion and sight of hope, the students will appreciate everything they are trying to do for them, not just in education but also in spiritual levels giving them that idea. That it's okay to fail nobody's perfect but the most important thing is to learn from their mistakes so they would hit harder until they success and get what they wanted.
I believe that being a teacher depend in to many things, something inside me starting to detect that being a teacher got a bigger meaning of that teachers do their job and get paid they have to love what they are doing and to do it with passion so success will follow if they bring out the best of them to invest in their students so they could bring out the best of them too.
All the positive thoughts and the hard work, they have to learn how to be responsible about their life and decisions easy, studying is a challenge nothing comes easy but its worth it, so good teachers will see that in their students and will define their skills, which give them different directions and many chances to a successful life and a positive mind.
