I chose the "pooh-pooh theory"
for me it's the most theory that make sense, because the languages develop by sounds, and of course the first sounds that the humans pronounce is sounds that he express his feeling, like express that he is in pain or he is suffering, happy, sad, surprise so he express his feeling by sounds.
after they make this sounds they will here it and recognize it, and this sounds will become familiar with, so the whole society  will use these words to express their feeling, and it will be common between them.
after that, all of these words are creates a new language.
*refuted by: many interjections have sounds that are not normally used in this language.
for example: the babes who when they here a cow produce her sound "mo" he will repeat after her and say "mo".
and when someone feel pain he will say "Ouch" and until these days we still use it.
to prove it: when they take tow little babes new born and raise them with mute women they didn't create a new language, so that's prove that we make or create the language by copy the others who are around us and by who make voices and sounds, so we don't create the sound by our self, we didn't born with this ability to create a new language without no hearing or listening to any thing  in the natural .
so we just copy each other, and make the same sounds , voices ...
