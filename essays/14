There are different perspectives about homework. Some of them agree with giving homework and stress its importance and some disagree with it. In my point of view as a mother and a teacher at the same time is that, homework is important for kids to practice what they have learned in class. It can keep their minds active to a certain point and apply it. But, teachers should not exaggerate with the amount of homework they give to the students. They must be logical with how much worksheets they give. I think they should consider that the student is doing his homework after a long and tiring day at school, so it must not be long for them to do. This point is very correct to young students such the elementary pupils who cannot and should not study so hard after school, so they can have some time for them to play or to practice their hobbies. As for the elderly ones, the amount of their homework should agree with the level they study and to serve a certain purpose or aim in order for them to achieve it successfully. Finally, I think that giving or not giving homework should be a matter of consideration and adopting it to reach certain goals.
