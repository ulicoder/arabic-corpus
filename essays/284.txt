Waking up early helps the body and the brain to be more active more healthier. So students will not preform better when the classes start later. As a students they have to arrange their time to be suitable for them and for their body. If students wake up late it doesn't mean they got a good sleep, because they can stay late at night or later than usual because they know that they are waking for example at 9 instead of 6:30.
If students go late at the morning this means that they will stay later than usual. In this late hours it will become very noisy outside because people who works are going home.
It is not suitable to families whose parents go to their work at 7 and takes their kids with them to school, or when they go home at the same time with their kids so they take them on their way.
So making schools start later doesn't solve problem but the opposite because in the future most of the positions, work start early. We can't ensure that by changing the time something better will change.
