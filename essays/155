The numbers of girls who earned computer science degree decrease in 2010. Some researches decline the reason to the media stereotyping. I agree with this point. Media stereotyping play big part of not encouraging girls to be in teach fields by showing smart girls ugly and wearing strange clothes with glasses. Moreover, they don't have social life and negative personality and no one wants to date them. I think we live in a make world. Gender stereotyping also has a major reason for this decreasing as a result, men control the tech fields and it isn't comfortable for girls to be in a workplace that the majority is men.
