Girls aren't pursuing careers in computing and teach fields. This is what is being discussed in the first two points / statistics. This phenomenon is very disturbing for me as a woman. This may be due to different reasons.
First, society including parents and teachers do not encourage girls to pursue these careers and that is because these careers demand long work hours and less flexibility at work, and all that doesn't suit women who have a full time job and a re also mothers. That requires investing a lot of energy and time and not all woman can do this job.
Second, those careers are less feminine. Women tend to choose topics that are close to their personality such as: teacher, social worker, nurse, and etc. Despite all that, we are noticing a rise in the percentage of girls who are pursuing careers in these fields today. maybe women priorities or preferences are changing or men are taking a bigger part at home today. All in all, I think that choosing a future career for girls should be taken only by them, and without any pressure or guiding.
