Books might be one of the largest tools for entertainment and education. E-books for instance, are electronic books that have appeared recently, and are getting quite popular.
E-books, might be preferable to some people, yet not for everyone. On the one hand, they offer the ability to read books online, which might make the process of reading easier, and more enjoyable. On the other hand, some people prefer reading paper books, due to the fact of finding the experience of reading much more appealing, when having a hard copy of them in hand, which provides them with the opportunity to satisfy their sense of smell and touch. Furthermore, Helm and his colleagues (2018) presented data which showed that college students preferred paper books over e-books. Ultimately, whether people / readers use e-books or paper books is up to them, it is only a matter of preference.
One can find e-books more useful and enjoyable, as they are found to be in the US and the UK. PWC Consulting (2019), showed that e-books were much more required than printed books in these two countries. Yet, one can also find that some people would still enjoy a printed book that appeals to their senses.
