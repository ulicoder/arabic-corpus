The technology became invades our world. Using tablet computers rather textbooks is more effective I think. Tablet application also entertains the users for several functions, such as video, music, it would be a great help in school.
Schools should replace textbook with tablet computers because schools every year change the copy of the books and that expensive for parents. Buying one tablet computers contains all the materials of the whole year is more saving money.
At the end, I think we should start using tablet computers instead of textbook, its help students to engage in technology.
