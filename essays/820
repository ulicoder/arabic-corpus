I choose “the Tool-Making source"  theory to talk about, because for me it is the most theory that does make sense, and also we as humans always do create, make and invent new things (including languages) it’s in our nature.
In other words we always trying to create new stuff like making tools using our hands but not only just that, moreover we create and invent new words almost every single day in so many different ways, for example, we combine two words together in order to create a new word with a new and different meaning, such like : girlfriend, if we take each word apart ( girl + friend) obviously each one has a specific and different meaning than the other and together they create a whole new word with completely different meaning.
another example of invented a new word is “google it “ it’s kind of a new word, which has no existence in the past ( before Google), and it does mean “search it in Google “. So I believe that this theory explains a lot about how does language development and grows, by adding and creating new words, sometimes from existence words sometimes not.
And the fact that the area that responsible for language very close to the area that responsible for object manipulation, explains our ability to brig words together like bringing two things together in order to make a tool. So for me, I really do believe that this theory explains exactly how does the language development.
