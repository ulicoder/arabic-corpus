Homework is a very debatable topic in the field of education. Teachers are left to decide whether to assign their students with assignments or not.
Students spend up to 8 hours at school, which is two quarters of their day. This seems like enough time for studying and absorption of information.
Hence, students might need the other two quarters to rest after spending sever or eight classes at school.
Schools do not always support students creativity, that is students cannot choose which topics they would like to study, or to focus on. This leads to the next point, which is, if they will have to deal with homework and tasks also after school there will be no time for them to practice the things they like and prefer to do.
Thus, homework do not give the students the chance to develop themselves away from school. It does not allow them to practice their hobbies, or spend time with their families. Therefore, I am completely against assigning homework for the students.
