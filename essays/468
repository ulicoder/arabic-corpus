"If a child can't learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn" in my opinion being an English teacher gives me responsibility and inspiration to teach the language to other students who are not aware of how important it is to learn the language and students who don't know anything about English because being able to teach other students the language and encouraging to learn English and speak it well can benefit them later in their life, because when they of traveling abroad they will be able to communicate and speak the language fluently. In addition teaching English to the students and explaining to them how useful and interesting it is to speak and know English, can give the inspiration and the will to learn more about and so they search about the culture and the right way of speaking the language well, and teaching english gives me the will to encourage and help other students who have problems in English and if I help them and communicate with about their problems and concerns, my relationship with the students can get better and they would be able to trust me ask me questions about the English subjects that they need help with the most in English. Furthermore, student who come from strict and non-functional familes who don't have time to teach their children English could give me more inspiration and a strong will to help the get familiar with the language so they can get better at speaking and writing the language, and would give the will search more about other English subjects that they don't know about. In conclusion, being a English teacher is such an inspirational and a useful job which could benefit not only the teacher but many other students and children who are curious and don't anything about and helping get better at it makes me so proud and very happy that I chose learning it.
