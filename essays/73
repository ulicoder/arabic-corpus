I believe that homework is a necessary thing in our life us teachers and as a parents too, in this way our children develop their time management and study skills and it helps them to manage their time and plan out study schedules, which are very useful and good skills to have it in all school years.
But I think our kids think something else, that homework eats up their time and they preferred to spend their time with chatting with family and friends and another fun activities.
