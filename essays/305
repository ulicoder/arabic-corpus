Women get less certificates of computer science degrees.
There are many explanation for gender gap in computer science, one possible explanation is women's choices. Women are raised with the beliefs that this kind of job isn't suitable for women it's men job.
Second possible explanation is that maybe men are good in this field more that women cognitively. Based on my experience in school my male classmates had better achievements in math and science than females.
