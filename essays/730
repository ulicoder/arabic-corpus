I would like to describe nice thing I did for someone maybe that was best thing I did. One day I was walking to get some snacks and ice cream from the shop, in way back home I saw a boy look by glass of the shop and looked like want something to eat. I asked him why you are crying, he told that he is a homeless boy and don't have anything to eat. I returned to him all my snacks and some money, and took him to orphanage in order to see his case. After that day I felt that doing something good to someone will make him happy all the life.
