Homework is a controversial topic since that some people claim that giving students homework is not good because kids should play and have fun after studying for hours in school. However, other people think that students should practice what they have learned in school. As a student and as a future teacher, I believe that students should not have homework every day.
After a long day of studying and focusing in schools, students should get the chance to rest, eat and have fun in order to recharge some energy.
Students should also get the chance to do what they like and enjoy doing. We should keep into considerations that not all topics are interesting to every students. Therefore, having extra time at home to play or practice a hobby.
However, homework may also be beneficial if it is given in the right time. It is not bad if students practice some material at home every once in a while.
As can be seen, homework is not that negative and bad for students if it is given correctly. Thus, giving the students their own space and time to do what they like have positive impacts as well.
