Some of people think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do, but that thing is not right because:
The older people have a lot of responsibilities to do that younger people don’t have like, they have to look after their children, they have to go to their work, they have to earn money, so they limited in their life more, while younger people don’t have this responsibilities, so they enjoy their life, like they free to do what they want and love, they meet their own friends and have fun with them, they can go to watch the recent movies.
Younger people have energy more than older people do they can travel where they want to go while some older people can't do that because they suffer from some disabilities that prevent them to travel and spend an entertaining time, once I go with my uncle family for a trip, I told my mom to go with us she refuses that because she suffers from pain in her legs, so she told me go and enjoy, we went to amusement park to play and having fun, really we have an enjoyable time and my mom was sorry to not be able to be with us and to the somethings she love, so we see that we enjoy life more than when we still younger.
Younger people can enjoy life today with using technology and follow it more the older people do, they can use social media to connect with their friends and they can create new friendships while, older people can’t use the technology in our days so they just can meet their friends in the traditional way.
Lastly, there is a huge difference between younger people life and the older people life, we can see that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do, they don't have responsibilities like older people, they can do whatever they want, and more energetic.
