Being a high school English teacher for about 9 years, and teaching, in particular, weak students, motivate me to register for my MA program. Thus, I would be able to use the right teaching methods and tools within class.
Firstly, a number of my students do not have the ability to write, read and even speak English properly. They are unable to actually acquire a foreign language for a tool must be implemented in the class in order to expand the student's knowledge regarding of how learning a second language.
Secondly, I hope that my MA program would help me, as well, to impart new techniques, which will help my students become more aware of the benefits of learning second language and English in particular.
Thirdly, having a number of LD students, who need special teaching methods will motivate any teacher to, actually, expand and learn new tools besides what they already knew. An MA program is, to some extent, would help a new teacher to use the right tools to be implemented within classroom.
In addition, another reason for registering the MA, is to practice my English daily, especially in courses. This is done in the written and spoken field.
Finally, I hope that my MA program will enhance my knowledge of English and increase my academic learning concepts. I, beside, hope to learn new aspects related to English in many realms.
