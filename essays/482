A good teacher believes in her / his students even when they do not believe in themselves.
The teacher can contain several adjectives that help him to teach his students in a good way. I think that the most important adjective that will makes him a perfect teacher is, to believe in his students, and to show them that he believes in them, in order to give them the power that makes them activate their hope and their actual capacity to succeed. He can do this by two ways, first, he have to find out the special thing in each individual of his students â€“ because every human being in our world has something special in his character, and this specific thing is the point that he can grow from it. Second, he have to inspire each student that he can develop himself from that point that he have.
