When evaluating something it is important to have the right knowledge and the right tool to do so. Some people claim that students should evaluate their teachers.
In my opinion it is very important to take students considerations whether it was positive or negative but not evaluate a teacher.
Students don't have the right knowledge to do such a thing, usually they will evaluate whether they like that teacher or not or whether they got good grades. Thus, this kind of an evaluation will turn into an emotional evaluation and this will not prove anything but rather how they feel. It is important to know how students feel about a teacher and this can be done by a questionnaire rather than an evaluation.
My perspective towards this is absolutely negative, a teacher studies about four years and learns the right technique to teach. Students don't have the ability to evaluate and judge the teacher.
Therefore, evaluating should be done by someone in the field of teaching, they would know what's right and what's wrong.
