Instagram is a free social network that is used worldwide. People use it to share videos and photos with their friends and followers. However, for many people Instagram has become an addiction, they use it almost every hour of the day in order to show others the way they live or how much they spend or on what they spend. According to Sheldon and Bryant (2016), they found that the amount of the time spend editing photos for Instagram has an important connection with the level of how much people are self-centered.
Since Instagram allows people to follow others, in which celebrities are included, this may cause people to get obsessed with what celebrities do, how they act and what they wear. A study by Dion (2016) has found that people who keep track of famous people on Instagram began suffering from a drop in life satisfaction.
People want to keep up with how celebrities live and imitate them, this may create a misconfusing in people's lives. But of course every side also have something positive, we take thing of Instagram is an enjoyable application that people use to pass the time, gain information about different places and people and most important follow different products that people sell and advertise on Instagram.
In my opinion, we should always try to use the best of things around us and use it in a beneficial way.
