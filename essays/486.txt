I agree, that the young people enjoy more than older people. Because young people have less responsibility, and I think they are having energy and spirit more than the older people.
The older people have a responsibility like: earn money and raising the children. Responsibility make the limited time for the older people like they can't enjoy, because they don't have enough time, they have families and work that they have to do. The young people have more chances to choose what they want to be on the future or what to do in their life. The young people travel to different places to get information about places that their never been there, and to try experiences that also you never did in your life and to face your fires. They don't have a limited time; the young people are more interested about things go around them, and young people are more connected with technologies more that the older people because, every day we have opportunities to go and enjoy our life like: to hang out with some friends, having time that you will never forget in your life.
The young people are more positive in their life, because they have a hope that their life will be more powerful and more entertainment to them and they will love their life, being who there are, because whatever you do you express their self, playing their kind of music, traveling with someone that you love or some friend that you are happy with, or your family members. They don't care about the world they just care about themselves what they did and what they will do in the future, this is more interesting thing to the young people.
