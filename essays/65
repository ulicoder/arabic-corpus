I strongly believe that school students perform better when the classes start later for various reasons. The first one is that waking up early at six am or seven am is not fully rested and if students are tired in school their brain can not function right. The second one is that students don't have blood floating in their brain to get on track at school. The last one is that most students will not fall asleep in class, because they can get more sleep and then they will be able to concentrate.
To sum up schools should be adjusted this method for the benefit of the students.
