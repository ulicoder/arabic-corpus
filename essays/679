My best vacation was in last year, it was in Poland, I go to Poland with my dance team because we was have a big dancing festival.
In this vacation I was have a lot of things I want to do, for example, my dream was to see the 'Baba' because I don't know him and in this vacation I see him and he high-five with me and kiss me.
In the festival we won because we were the best team. In the last day when we going to the airport to go back home, the flight team EL-Al called our teacher and say to him: all the team have a free fly because we represented Israel in the world.
