Homework is an important issue, it helps the students to practice the material at home. Doing homework helps the students to increase their knowledge of the topics that they learn at school. It is very necessary for students. I do believe that homework is needed badly. This way, students will not forget the material and it will stuck in their minds for a long period of time.
On the other hand, resting and playing after spending all day studying is also an important issue. However, students shouldn't spend all day playing and resting. Parents need to organize the time for their children. They should allow them to play and rest for a limited time in each day. Therefore when the kids want to study and to do their homework, they will study hard and in a comfortable way, because they have been resting before studying.
To conclude, parents should organize the time for their children. They need to give them a limited time to rest and to play and to give them a limited time to study and to do their homeworks also. Because our brain needs both: homework and playing, in order to do better results at school.
