The number of students in a class should not be more than fifteen. I think that the less number of students in a class, the more marks they will get. In my classes, there are about twenty eight students. it is really hard to get to everyone. The average of English at school is hardly ok. I cannot reach to every student. They need to be taught in small groups in order to work on each skills and weakness points.
