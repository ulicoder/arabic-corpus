I think that single-sex schools is not a good idea (because I strongly agree with socialism and I believe in social life), so I can't imagine that life will be perfect if girls and boys don't cooperate with each other. In addition, when God inspires us in this universe he didn't diverse us and he didn't say this in any of his religions.
Moreover I believe that heterogeneous groups is beneficial, and human being can acquire many information one from another (not just from the educational side). The most important is love. Love and emotion toward the other sex (gender) will make life worth it, so I don't think that man will live without love.
In conclusion, single-sex school has many positive aspects than just learning and getting high grades.
