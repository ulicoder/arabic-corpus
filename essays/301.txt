Several research found different reasons why using Instagram is not actually good like what many people think. People might think that using Instagram helps in being social and having more social relationships because you can follow people and interact with them through this application. I personally do not use Instagram and in this paper I discuss how this application have negative effects on its users.
I think using Instagram causes people not to live freely as if they were living without having Instagram. That is, when people want to practice any action in their daily lives, they would consider posting and documenting each and every event that happens. So, they would not be doing it honestly or naturally because it will be like someone is observing them, and they want to impress him/her.
