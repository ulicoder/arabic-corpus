I did my presentation more than two weeks ago, when I was preparing it together with Sham, I felt confident that I did my best and I will do a good job, we tried our best to have a good PowerPoint presentation.
When it was our turn and we get out in front of our classmates I felt overwhelming; I started good but after that I felt nervous and as a result I start reading from the PowerPoint presentation without being attention which something that I hate when others do it, slowly when I saw the support from my classmates and how they participated with us, I started to relax and felt more comfortable, I introduced the activity and finished my presentation.
After the presentation I felt that I could do a lot better and that I'm not satisfied enough about my presentation and I had couple of things that i will enhance for my next presentation, for example: I will prepare the material very will especially the key words and never ever to read from the power point presentation because it's for students to keep up with us, and most important try to stay relax because there is no point from being nervous and that will just ruin my presentation, so I have to be confident about my work and to trust myself, to trust that I can do it and excel it
