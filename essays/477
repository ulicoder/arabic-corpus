To teach is to touch a life.
From my childhood, I was dreaming to become an English teacher, it was my big dream that I worked hard to make it real.
I knew that becoming a teacher is not an easy thing, you must work a lot and study hard and know the real meaning of teaching.
Teaching is a great thing to do because you make other persons know more learn more and you are making new generations that have a big goal in their life, which is education.
These values made me more interesting in teaching, so I start searching more and more about teaching and I keep asking many questions about it.
I knew that education is the most important thing in our life, and I knew that it would be a great thing to make pupils educate, that is because I am the one who make them study and make them interesting in studying, so it is a lot of responsibility and I would be proud if I really make other people more educated and make them love education, what other things I would be proud of if I was the teacher of a person and make him an important person in society.
So now I am sure that teaching is not an ordinary thing, teaching is a life value, maybe the most important value in life, it touches our hearts and minds, it makes us great humans and I will be very proud to make people love teaching and know its real meaning.
