Instagram is a social interaction app which allow people to post pictures online. In this app your followers can see your pictures and react on them.
On the one hand, it is usual that when a person wants to post a picture so others can see, he would like to look in his best look. On the other hand and due to this fact, people will start editing their pictures many times.
This may affect the person's personality. According to Sheldon and Bryant (2016) "the amount of time spend editing these pictures was correlated with the level of narcissism".
Another point is that, when people see others on Instagram and see their edited lives, they wills tart feeling unsatisfied with their own. Specially when they follow different bloggers and celebrities. Dion (2016) claims and supports this idea by saying that "people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started experiencing a decline in life satisfaction".
To conclude, Instagram has both negatives and positives. It gives the chance to contact with others, to enjoy seeing others. But on the other way it contains many fake aspects, like the editing and the others' lives.
