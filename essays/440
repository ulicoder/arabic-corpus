I think that the most interesting article is "Posting (Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job)", because teenagers could earn money by posting their pictures and this was new information's for me, they can post pictures doing activities they love, it is much easier from a lot of other jobs that contains training and physical ability all that they have to do is to wear something from a specific brand and post it and they can get money for it.
I think that this article is the most researched and presenting the best evidence because there are numbers, names (names of teens with experiences in posting in Instagram, organizations, there is also expert opinion (Helen Boogzel, the CEO of Boogzel Apparel).
