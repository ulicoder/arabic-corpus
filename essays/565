I don't agree that a teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I believe that the ability to relate well with students is a very important and required teaching skill, and a good teacher must have this characteristic. However, if a teacher doesn't have an excellent knowledge of the subject that he would teach, he will not know what to do during the lesson – what to teach and how to teach a specific material, even though he can perfectly manage the class.
So, a good teacher must have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught first, and then to pay attention for the other required characteristics.
For example, a science nature teacher who is a very good teacher can't go to a class a teach them English or any other subject that he doesn't have an expanding knowledge in.
