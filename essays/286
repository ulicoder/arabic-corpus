Instagram is a very popular app, actually it is one of the famous apps. Millions of people uses Instagram daily, spend hours on it without even realizing that. Many studies discussed the effects of Instagram on people.
Dion (2016) found that people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started experiencing a decline in life satisfaction.
People that are following famous people have become thinking that these people are perfect, that their appearance is good better than theirs and that their whole life, home, work is perfect, like they are living in a pinky world, so they start to compare their lives together, they start to realize that they don't have even things they don't need.
Following famous people and watching their posts a lot, make people obsess to be like them to have the same things, and if they feel that they can't offer these things they will feel bad and upset. Instagram really has an effect on people and it may cause one's life to be miserable if he don't know exactly what he needs and why for.
