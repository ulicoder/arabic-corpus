The filter bubble is a search engine which describes infromation that we search for on our phones or computers. This engine gusses what the information that we will search for in the next time based on information about us like: location, click behavior and the search history. It will show us only things that we like to see or things that related to what we search for before.
For example: if I searched for my favorite singer all the time, the filter bubble will show me only things that relates to his news, music and so on.
In the same time, it will hide many information from me that I am not interested in according to my history search.
In my opinion, this filter bubble affects us negatively, therfore it causes us to get significantly less contact with contradicting viewpoints, and causing us to become intellectually isolated from the world news and limited in our education and knowladge, because as we know "social media" became an integral part in our lives, in addition most of us know what happenning in the world by facebook or google. So, this filter bubble prevents us from being oppening to the world's news because it gives us information about specific topics that ralates to our past activities.
