In life we can do many things and if you have goals you can achieve. If you havenâ€™t have goals you will not succeed in your life.
I have many goals in my life for example to be a football player. I like to be a player because I am ready to spend all my time playing football.
There are many important games for me I wish to become a player in the future because I like to be famous like many players around the world.
