People mostly achieve what they want to achieve from life in their youth. There must be a reason for that. Young people are usually energetic and enthusiastic more than elders. They are being exposed newly to the world, and having new experiences that they never had before. Which make them happier and more interested with their lives. In their youth they are discovering the world around them, trying to understand things and connect them, and developing new ideas and perspectives.
Moreover, youngers are more attractive and beautiful, which gives them a good feeling about themselves. For instance, I once saw a picture of my grandma when she was young, and she was so pretty and full of life. Yet now she seems more old and tired and she somehow lost her beauty.
In addition, the young ones do not have big responsibilities and worries; therefore, they are simply enjoying their lives, having fun, and doing what they like to do without limitations and worries. For example, when they want to go out with friends, they will not have to think of where to keep their kids, what to cook before going out, or how to convince their spouse that they are going out with friends!
Yet, the old ones could enjoy their lives too, but their happiness will be different from the one for youngers. An old man can be happy by seeing his kids growing in front of him, or can be happy if he provided the good education for his kids.
So yes, I do believe that young people enjoy their lives more than the older ones, because they are more free, more attractive, more energetic. Therefore, they are happier. Lastly, it depends on the person himself and his view about life.
