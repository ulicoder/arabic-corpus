I do not agree with the statement above. Young people have better health more energy and ability to do different activities to make their life joyful, but that does not mean that people cannot enjoy their life when they get older.
The way young people spend their time in order to enjoy their life is very different from old people, and that is because old people have different perspective on how to enjoy life.
Young people enjoy their life by going to the club, cinema, the mall, hanging out with friends and doing life-changing activities such as bungee jumping or jumping from an airplane. Some old people enjoy doing what the young ones are doing and some have their own different ways of having fun such as reading, sewing walking and many more, for young people it might seem boring but the most important thing is that they are enjoying in doing these stuff.
There is a lot of old people that have the energy of the young, some might tell that age is just a number and nothing is stopping them from doing what they love. There is a lot of old people that might shock you, by doing thing that young people do not dare to do or scared to do. Watching an old man surfing might be shocking for some but that does not mean it is impossible.
If it was sewing, reading, writing, walking, bungee jumping or swimming with sharks, the activity in itself it does not matter, what matter the most is the feeling that comes out from the activity matter the most, every person has the right to be happy in what they are doing and enjoying their life until the very last minute. Building beautiful memories does not end by the time the person gets old, but it ends when the person stop enjoying his life.
