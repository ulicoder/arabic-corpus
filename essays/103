Class size has a high effect on students results and how teachers-students relation will be affected toward learning.
Reducing class size has been seen for me as an important way to improve a student's educational experience and their grades.
The more smaller number of students in classes, the more a teacher can give to each student. In fact, the class will be quieter than able to be taught than the larger ones. For me, 15 students in each class is enough, so you can control and pass for them the what is the educational system requires and more.
