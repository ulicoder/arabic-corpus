This is the best topic to writing for there, my story begin since I was a child, when my lovely teacher asked me to do a vocation, and I faced many difficult and cried so much because no one can help me to do it.
Then my super women the best teacher in the world in my opinion, help me and do a super work, she created inside me feeling that in some day I want to be like her.
She have a lot of a goodness deed and humanity I don't see in my life like us, she make me satisfaction because in some day teacher like her teach, me I don't forget anything she do it, she teach me to be in the future a stronger women with effectively deed, and to achieving what I want to be and donâ€™t forget any dream without achieved it.
This teach no word can describe her, I so proud because in the future I will be like her to do a goodness, to understand the student not just to learn in school they should plays and jokes and do the all what makes between him and her the piece and the friendly connect to success in the society and have a good behavior with stronger personality.
By the end this teacher reach me to has a motivation to be like her in some day she is the most best idol and pattern from the world.
