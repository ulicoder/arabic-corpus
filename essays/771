Fast food are a global problem that the world face, a lot of people from all over the world are depend on it as a main serving, this problem is very worrying especially for the coming generation, the little kids, so, we should help to reduce this phenomenon by many ways, like banning fast food restaurants in schools,
On the other hand. Fast food are so harmful for all of the people. It causes a lot of ailments for them. In addition, children like to imitate each other and buy tasty fast food from restaurants but, unfortunately many parents don’t have enough money to give their children everyday, they prefer to make their children food in home which costs less money.
On the other hand, many parent don’t have enough time to make their own children food, so they will have to face many difficulties about this.
I think that it will be so good that the parents take care of their children, and try to save their children from fast food harm.
