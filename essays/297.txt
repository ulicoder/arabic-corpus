Homework has been a controversial issues recently since some teachers still adhere to it and some are rejecting it on the contrary. Homework is asking the students to study or to do a further task at home. Since home is considered to be a place for rest not only teachers reject homework, but also parents and kids themselves. However, still homework is something important and should not be rejected at all. Maybe we should find a compromise for both sides where we still have homework. In this paper I discuss why homework is important.
