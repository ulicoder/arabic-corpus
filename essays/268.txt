Pokémon Go, can be considered as a virtual reality game, as far as my observation goes, I noticed the fact that many students varying from junior high to high school have become fond of this game, making it popular even among adults. The game can be indeed amusing, where one needs to go outside and search for a Pokémon near. Nevertheless, it is as time consuming as it is as much amusing, and that is why its disadvantages outweigh its advantages.
Despite the fact that a lot of people or students find the game quite interesting and fun, it is just as harmful as it could get. The game lures people to it in a very addictive way. Even though I have no personal experience of trying the game but I saw what it could do to others who were consumed by it. Furthermore, just like any other online game, it is a tool of hiding more behind a screen, as if the world does not have enough hiding behind screen, a year ago it was this game and this year PUBG is trending, which is not any different from Pokémon Go.
Parents should pay more attention to the time they allow their children to play these games, for instance they can restrict its use for an hour a day. In addition, they should focus on how to enhance their social normal face to face skills, instead of letting them play these adductive, and destructive games. Even though the Pokémon Go phenomenon has mostly faded, it has left a great deal of destruction, and that is because of the amount of traffic accidents it has caused, turning the game into a 'death wish'.
Ultimately, opinions vary regarding the game, but one could not agree more to the fact that it is a harmful consuming game, in terms of health and its effects on the brain and also the number of people who had been injured because of such a game. People need focus more on living life as it is, and that is done by natural communication, not hiding behind a screen.
