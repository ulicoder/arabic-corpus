My favorite season is summer. This season is very comfortable for all: kids and adults. It is the perfect atmosphere to do many different outdoors activities, such as BBQ parties, swimming in the sea and going parks. As a parent, I don't have to worry about getting my children flu from the bad weather. When the summer starts, the sun sets lately and you have a long time to do whatever you want without worrying about sunset. Also, the important thing is the two months summer vacation.
