All-girl school have been gaining popularity in recent years because of the belief that girls learn better when they aren't competing with boys. I totally disagree with this style of schools for many reasons. Firstly these years of children are the best time to expose them to company of the other gender, they have a good impact on each other. They can learn each other behavior and that can lead them to learn from each other and be prepared for the out life. Secondly, it's more harder for male teachers to teach at all-girl school, they won't have the tools and the way the girls need. They won't be able to interact with them since they are not used to deal with boys at school. Girls will see them as stranger and won't be good listener and won't deal with them correctly. It will be a big problem for the ministry to hire female teachers for them. To sum up, it's better to have mixed schools.
