The evaluating is an important element in life, because when you evaluate someone you will have general idea about him/her, this idea can help us as a teachers to know what the students think about us, not only that also to know where to focus on. Evaluating can help the mentor in the school to know how to deal with the students, personally, I agree with the point, that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. In addition, from my point of view, there are different teachers in the school, which lead to different characters and different ways of teacher, as a result, students may have the chance to evaluate certain method of teaching, throughout evaluating form for each teacher and when the teacher has the awareness of the better teaching method for the students this might improve the teaching system, and help the students to develop their mental skills.
