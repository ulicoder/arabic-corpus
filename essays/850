Recently women are not encouraged to pursue science as often and they are more likely to leave the industry within a year compared to their male counterparts. If we look at the high school grades we discover that girls achieve better grades than boys, yet for females who do pursue computer science at university level, they find themselves being outnumbered by males. Analysts say that the low numbers are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys. From my point of view, I see that this issue is related to the society because it encourages the males more than females, to clarify, women has to take care of the children, house-working, plus her job so she can't be in equilibrium and not being responsible for raising the children as their mom do, gives the females the opportunity to be accepted to the high tech easily, by reason of the hours the high tech require them.
As a conclusion I can say that I advocate single women to work in the high tech because they can be arise from more than married women.
