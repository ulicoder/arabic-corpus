There is an invisible shift in how information is flowing on the internet, it's like now you will see what you are interest about, for example; when your using facebook and keep clicking on specific item so facebook automatically filtering the news feed to show you things that your keep clicking or searching for.
Now google is using a lot of different signals to determine our search results and it's depending on our location, age, and interests, in other words the information I get is no longer the same information that you get, maybe we are searching for the same news or the same material but the results that we get is obviously not the same, actually you we are getting it depending on a several factors as I mentioned before.
From my point of view there is a problem with this, it's like while the internet showing us what we want to see it's not necessary what we need to see it because, the internet must be a way for us to see and to discover a new creations, new people, new ideas, new researches not just what we want to see.
