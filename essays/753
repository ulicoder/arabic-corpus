Last year at one morning me and my friends we planned a trip to Haifa. We waited for the bus in 10:00 p.m. in the station. The time was 11:00 o'clock when we arrived. We walking very long time in Haifa beach. We going to the Grand Kanyon in "Kiryat Bialik". I loved the bowling game and the snooker. After all that we eat hamburger in the MacDonald I donâ€™t love be we late the bus and waiting more hour in the station. All this trip I loved because this was with my friend.
