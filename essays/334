In my opinion, I think mixed school are better than single-sex school.
In a classroom setting where students are mixed with boys and girls is imperative that children learn how to deal with other gender. Because of that, after they finish school they are going to face the world with mixed gender, they can't separate the world into two genders.
In additions to, students can learn from their experiences. Both girls and boys can learn from each other, so it is very important to share their experiences together.
Together, boys and girls can strengthen the relations between the two genders. At the end, I think it is very equal to let boys and girl to stay and learn in the same place. As well they can feel similar.
