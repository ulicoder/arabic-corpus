In my opinion, and the way I see people drive and behave on streets, I think people, countries, governments must put a law, when to let young people or teenagers take a driving license. It's necessary because of few important reasons:
First, teenagers are not yet responsible or aware about the dangerous situations they might commit on streets.
Secondly, they are still young, they act, behave in such a rude way and moreover, they do not respect other drivers on the street because they act foolishly.
Thirdly, lots of teenagers today drive their car under the influence of drugs or alcohol which might cause terrible accidents and cause damage to other innocent drivers.
