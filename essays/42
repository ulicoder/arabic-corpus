Personally, I really do not like using or hearing curse words. I find it annoying. I always give advices and instructions to my students about not using any curse words.
I believe that not only using course words could be considered offensive, but hearing it is also as disturbing. Therefore, I try to minimize my exposure to such words by clearly expressing my disapproval of it.
