Instagram is application that people use to upload their pictures on it and to share their life with others. Instagram has advantage and disadvantage. One of the disadvantage that people see themselves as the top, they waste their time in editing the pictures they upload to be the best as they can. As a result, I agree with researcher Sheldon and Bryant (2016) they indicates, "that the amount of time spend editing photos for Instagram was significantly correlated with the level of narcissism". In other words, if people waste their time on Photoshop their pictures, this shows how much they love theirself, which is not good.
Loving yourself too much can develop for an acceptable situation. Also, can cause psychological problem for this people. This leads him to realize that he is the only one and the best not like anyone.
The other researcher Dion (2016) found that if people followed a lot of celebrities they will reach a point that they will not be satisfied about their life, which very right, they will start doing anything in order to become like them, I saw a lot of teenagers who wants to imitate them in everything, this leads them for hard situation when they want to commit suicide because they couldn't reach this point.
To conclude, people must know how to use Instagram correctly.
