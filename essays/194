Technology had affected our lives, especially the cellphones. In general, when we want to make a phone call we intend to use the phone apps before making phone calls, according to study by O2 company that present that "telephone" apps on smartphones - that is using your phone to make actual phone calls are only the fifth most used apps among the general public 75% of Millennials prefer texting to calling. Moreover, people used to call when the thing is urgent and they need fast reply to their issue and that is according to RIT researcher study on calling vs. texting. Personally, I make a phone call when I need quick answer but most of the time I only use texting. Phones are beneficial and important but sometimes it steals our time. I reckon that ten years from now phones will stay important because it is now one of the basics to communicate with each other.
