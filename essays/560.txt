I have to say that I totally agree with this statememnt for obvious reasons that we all share as students or teachers.
THE main purpose of education is to spread knowledge, to help others learn and know what you have to share with them to taught them ,as a teacher knowing your subject and having an excellent knowledge in it is an important thing that we sure need to explain the material in a proper way so our students can get it easier, and here' comes the importance of the teacher's ability to relate well with the students, its by finding ways and methods to deliever these informations to the students to let them get it as easier as it could be.
Our goal is to teach students we wont get anywhere if we only focused on saying what we know without making sure that the student get it ,there must be a connection between the teacher and his students he has to find their weak and strength spots he has to find the best way to deliever the informations and the material they need to know from him.
Bottom line is: a teacher with no methods no techniqes no stratigies no matter how much knowledge he has it well be only a waste of time for both him and his students, as ateacher you have to connect to your class searching for any new, easy or fast methods to make them understand, remember its not about how intellegant you are, its about how much your students geting from you how intellegant are they because of you.
