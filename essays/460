Lately, I started teaching kids in my neighborhood. In the beginning, I found it very tough and hard. I was getting angry, as they did not understand immediately what I taught them. But very soon I sat with myself, I realized that this is not helpful at all to be mad in teaching, to be mad it is the opposite, it makes the children stressed and afraid of asking.
Afterwards I decided to take a breath before I get angry and try to create another way of explaining an issue or a subject, this wasn't easy for sure but I saw that each time I got better by coping with each lesson, the kids themselves felt more confident and motivated, myself went closer to the kids.
This experience with my kids, made me remember how I hated my teacher at school when they neglected me, as I did not understand a subject, and made think twice today to repeat their behavior with me.
Choosing to be a teacher now is very competitive for me, especially to exercise how to be patient to pupils, and I am looking forward to adopt the right skills to deal with teaching more practical.
