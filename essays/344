Evaluating teachers have been one of the most innovative thing that has become a habit in our era. Which in some schools, a questionnaire were given to students at the end of X period learning time in order to evaluate their teachers.
I do believe this is a good issue in practice which it evaluate the teachers performance and the way they teach. This enable us to know whether the teachers education system is effective for the students or not, as is the case if the student is internalizing the teaching materials.
Moreover, the evaluation method will help in judging the teacher progress and their abilities in the most holistic way.
In addition this evaluation in my opinion will increase the teachers' skills and motivate them to teach student in the best way they could. Not only, but also if the teachers know that students is going to evaluate them they will try their best to improve themselves to better way.
To conclude, I do believe that this is a very beneficial issue to evaluate teachers.
