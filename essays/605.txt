I did a presentation about the story “A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings”. I did the presentation with my classmate Dima Ibraheem, she is a very great partner and a friend, we did the presentation together all of it, we analyzed the story and answered the questions together. Although, we worked on it for only two days (Friday and Saturday) but we worked very hard on it, we understood the story very well.
When we presented in the class I was very nervous when the other group presented before us but when our turn came all the stress gone because I was sure of the material (know the material by heart). When I started talking I felt comfortable by seeing Dima making a comfortable environment by asking questions in the beginning. The class was great, the presentation was very good but we could do better.
Dima and I helped each other while presenting, if one of us forgot a word the other one helped her, we were and still are very engaged to each other, we have a great harmony.
Dima and I thought of so many activities but at the end we chose an activity that allows students to use their imagination and creativity, which was drawing something that is related to the story and pass it to the person that sits next to them. I think that the activity was really fun and allowed them to use their imagination.
At the very end Dima asked the students a question which was; if you were with the people that threw stones at the old man, what would you do? This question was a very good question and a good way to end the presentation.
So I think that the presentation was very good, and the activity was great, we succeeded in participating all the students and make them having fun.
