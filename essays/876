One of the most popular social networking applications is Instagram. This service can bring users closer to people, they can upload photos and share videos or even messages. Thus, it is fun, easy, and creative application. However, some people might put too much energy and time into the way they picture their lives through photos or videos on social media.
According to the study by Sheldon and Bryant (2016), people are considered more narcissistic, the more they spend their time editing and uploading photos for Instagram. Consequently, I believe that some users of Instagram pay attention to their appearance rather than their inner soul. Moreover, their main concern is themselves. They tend to show themselves in their own eyes, no matter what others think or feel as a result of their own photo.
Instagram has another feature besides editing or uploading. Users can follow celebrities. This feature is very dangerous and may lead to disturbing consequences. According to the study by Dion (2016), people experience less self-satisfaction, the more celebrities they follow. Some users start to imitate or envy them. They start to believe that the need to live in a perfect world and forget their own reality. In addition, users who follow celebrities may suffer depression, less self-esteem and less confidence.
To sum up, users of Instagram should be careful while using it. They need to spend their valuable tine with people they like and feel comfortable with them. Users need to feel confident about their own personality and reality. Using Instagram is fun and can get people more closer to each other if they use it appropriately.
