How a teacher can know how good he is at his job? A teacher needs the help of his students to get feedback about his learning style and methods.
Students should feel comfortable around their teachers. Therefore, if the school asks the students to evaluate their teachers, this leads the students to feel more involved and connected to the teacher.
In addition the evaluation should be emphasized on the materials of the class and the methods used to teach, not focused on the person / teacher himself.
All in all, the students should evaluate their teachers and the teachers must have feedbacks in order to develop and be better in their jobs and to be more connected with the students.
