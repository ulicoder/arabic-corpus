Since students are more likely to listen and observe teachers more than any other people which will effect and influence their learning process their reflection on teachers must be taken into account.
The role of teacher is to teach and to convey information to the students who are consider as the recipient. Therefore, the best way to check and evaluate if teacher was able to convey the information is to ask their audience. When students evaluate their teacher that might help her/him to improve and find the best appropriate methods that suits them.
Also, giving students this chance might teach them to be more critical listen to teacher more, and to learn how to create a useful feedback.
