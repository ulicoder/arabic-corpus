My favorite season would probably be spring. I love spring time, because we are coming to life after the harsh colder seasons. The spring is that is where I want be because I am a person who hates the cold. I like to sit on my balcony and drink a cold orange juice, smell the flowers and looking to the birds are chirping early at the morning. I just think it is a fabulous season.
