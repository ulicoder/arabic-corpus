In the past few years we can see that the percent of the unhealthy students in the schools is high.
One of the reasons is that students eat fast food in the schools and because of that the banned suggestion came out.
For me, I agree with the ban for the fast food restaurants in the schools, because it will to decreasing the percent of the unhealthy students and this unhealthy bad eating habit.
The disadvantages of banning the fast food restaurants will not affect as much as the advantages effect the students.
One of the disadvantages is that the students will get bothered of closing and banning these restaurants but with the time they maybe see that this ban help them of making a healthy life.
