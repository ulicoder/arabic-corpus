Teaching offers the chance to change other people's lives permanently for the better.
Teachers can help to develop students' subject knowledge and maybe even their mind personality.
A teacher's ability to relate well with students more excellent than teaching the material or giving them a new knowledge because this treatment will present the character of the teacher to his/her students.
So the teacher is the person who the children spend more time than the parents.so it is important for the teacher to relate well with the students more than only sharing knowledge. I support my opinion for following reasons
Firstly, giving only material on the class maybe cause misunderstanding for students I mean that some student doesn't understand the material well so the teacher will be giving it more and more time in the class.
Secondly, students also can't understand just from material so the teacher can have shared them some of life experiences to ease for the student to understand.
So thatâ€™s my thinking about the teacher good relation with his/her students.
