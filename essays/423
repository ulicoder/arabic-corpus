Actually I know a little bit information about the clean eating, information that I have been heard from myÂ mom, my friend and from fat people...
So I have a previous idea about these articles.
So I want to say that's not an easy way to organize your life about the healthy and clean food just.
It's very hard very very hard to change your lifestyle because you want to lose weight but in the other hand its beneficial to keep your body in a healthy mood so, if we want to follow a diet we have to see our doctor and let him decide which diet are fits our bodies to not lead ourselves and our bodies to a bad effects that may let us lose weight more than we want.
The article's purpose is to make us aware from hurting our body because of clean eating dietary, and to explain for us what is the healthiest diets.
Each article has his own purpose but all in all all this articles talks about the same idea which is clean eating.
