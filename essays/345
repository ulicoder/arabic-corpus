As many teachers stressed, students especially teenagers need 8 to 9 hours of sleep at least every day. This issue basically affects their mental health, performance and even though their physical skills, either in a good or bad hand.
Starting "late time" school will enhance the students focus and improve their mood in the lectures and make them feel well doubtful.Their physical performance will also rise.
In my opinion, me as a student and mother of a two years baby, starting late school should be late, it's because a lot of thing are supposed to be done before leaving home.For instance, sitting down and having a good, healthy breakfast. Through which the brain will also open up, will think of a smarted need if it is for me or to my baby, in addition our concentration during the day will go up.
