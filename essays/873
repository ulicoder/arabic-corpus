Instagram is one of the most popular platforms that allows users to share photos and videos online. As an Instagram user you can share your photos of your favorite places or food so all of your friends on Instagram can see them. These photos will remain on Instagram as long as you wish to. Thus is a great way of keeping you photos from getting lost or damage. Furthermore, posting pictures or videos on Instagram are easy and fun. For instance, you can use different filters and effects to make your photos more artistic. Using Instagram may improve the communication with people and friends. Some people find it easier for them to communicate with others via photos and videos instead of chatting or texting.
However, a study made by Sheldon and Bryant (2016) shows that the more users of Instagram spend time editing photos for Instagram the more they raise their level of narcissism. Another study indicates that following a lot of famous people on Instagram may cause users feel less happy with their lives (Dion, 2016).
In short, Instagram could be a wonderful platform for capturing and sharing your memories with your friends and followers. However, users of Instagram have to pay attention of the amount of time they spend and the pages they follow.
