Actually, as a teacher I always appeal the Ministry of Education changes all the rules and approach at schools to reduce the number of students in a class, and I have a serious sentence that I use all the time: "Learning will be successful if it applied on small groups". I teach in classes that have a large number of students (30-32 student in each class), and all the classes which I teach have heterogeneous teaching levels so it is very hard to teach in such classes.
I feel that it is important to teach in small groups when I teach small classes, the students benefit a lot, especially those who have a low teaching level. In my opinion, the perfect number of students in a class has to be no more than ten students.
