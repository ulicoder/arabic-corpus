In the life nature, everyone have his best life stage, and it's meant to be from the god to make us all pass the human life levels with all of the difficulties that we as humans will face it urgent or later, and everyone has his personal opinion or vision about certain thing and my opinion is like that:
It's obvious that they are many more advantages for young people and because of that.
May the younger people experience more interesting experiences or emotions that makes them feel that they are enjoy their life more than the older one do, but there is some of them don’t enjoy their life as they supposed to do because every person have his own problem and concerns and like I mention in the beginning every level have its difficulties in this life, yes certainly they are young and in there joyful level of time but it's not a rule or a base, that the younger people have to enjoy life more than older people do.
And there is many of old people still enjoying their life more than the youngers do, and feeling happy and satisfied with their life, usually if we saw a wintry man or woman we think directly that they don’t feel the please or they don't have the right gratify from their life due to their poor health or their old body and maybe the ugly shape, but some of them and I think the most still enjoy and love the life, in order to do more good things for their children. Some of this old people feeling the enjoyment just when they remember how their children grown up, and what a great achievements they had accomplished in the past whether in their childhood or adulthood, or they just enjoying the life because they had overpass a hard incidents and in this old age they finally have the right time to do many interesting things and advantages.
So "the age it's just a number", if the younger people have better shape or more good health doesn't mean they happier in their own life or they enjoying in their life more.
