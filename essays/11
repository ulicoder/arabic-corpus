I think that using bad language in school and particularly in class is something that is immoral. I always tell my students that using such bad words reflects their morals, their attitudes. So, before uttering these words, they should think.
I also think that I am as a teacher must be an example for them not to use bad words at all in my class, I never addressee any of my learners with bad words, and they take me as their model.
Since I teach teens, high-school students, I am very careful to use appropriate vocabulary and even to instruct them to use beautiful words even whenever they speak to each other. If it happens and I hear any of them using any bad words, I would just look them in the eyes so they know it is not acceptable in my class. I believe that teachers should instruct their students to use the best language they can.
