Usually we eat fast food in the vicinity of schools.
Recently the fast food become thing that we can't live without it even we all day eat fast food in the school and out the school. The fast food is a bad thing and a bad habit that we can't ban the most to eat fast food and if we ban the fast food in the vicinity of schools we will help many people to save themselves.
In my opinion I agree and suggest that fast food restaurants should be banned in the vicinity of schools because the fast food have many damages and it no healthy as we should ban eating fast food, because the fast food damage on ourself.
We should try to reduce this habit if we can decrease from this bad habit we will have a good health.
If we can ban the fast food in the schools we will have a good health and we can eat the healthy food, we can eat the food that the mothers cook in the home because this food is the healthier food.
In the end, I advise that we should eat healthy food and to get away of the fast food, the fast food have many damages, and it have many body problems. So the healthy food is the best.
