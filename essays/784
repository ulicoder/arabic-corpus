Tablet computers are considered beneficial and enjoyable devices. However, I believe they cannot replace traditional textbooks.
From my experience as a teacher, most pupils enjoy learning when they use their tablet computers. Moreover, they believe that traditional textbooks are heavy and old-fashioned. They also believe that computers are more efficient and easier. According to a study by Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt (2011), pupils who use iPads had 20% progress in their math exam more than pupils who use traditional textbooks.
Another example from my experience, pupils admit that computers make them more engaged in the lesson. One pupils clarifies that he feels in the center of the learning process. He said: "I am there, I can do better in front of my computer. I am in the center." Thus computers are more interesting and enjoyable devices.
On the other hand, books are valuable and useful. They can be used any time, anywhere without power or limitations. According to a study by Singer and Alexander (2016) pupils enjoy learning through computers yet, learning by books is better. Thus, books contribute to both fun and gaining information as well.
To sum up, schools should have a mixture system where pupils use both computers and books as beneficial tools in a successful learning process.
