Personally, I agree that school should start at 10 am instead of 8 am, so the students can get more sleep in the morning and they would feel happier as well as being less stressed out. In addition it could also reduce the amount of time kids are left alone at homes, because of the working schedules of their parents. It also can improve their learning abilities and skills, cause when there is adequate sleeping time available, then there is an associated rise in the student's grades.
