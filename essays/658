I like to do many things and it is: to draw, to write, to do sport and many things else. I want to visit Hollywood because I want to see my best singer Beyonce. She is my example. My big and the first goal in my life that I want to achieve is to be a doctor someday. I love to be a doctor because I love to help to the people and to glad them, to give them hope and to give them another chance to live. That's my dream. My second goal is to be a Jombaz player because that's my hope, when I feel not good I play Jombaz because it take all my native energy I hope my all dreams will come true.
