The Filter Bubble talk about the algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user without asking him or knowing if that user would like to see just what he like or seeing other things and gain more information.
And to me it was shocking because I didn’t know how these websites work and make money by using me, and the more they get information about me the more they produce money and honestly it's uncomfortable for me.
So because of that, in my perspective, I think the filter bubble is useless; it's true that it has positive things like not showing us what we dislike, for example (a car accident etc.), but the negatives are more than the positives, like its restrict creativity, "Creativity is often sparked by the collision of ideas from different disciplines and cultures." (As in the filter bubble chapter says), and also what the professor Yochai Benkler argues "To be the author of your life, you have to be aware of a diverse array of options and lifestyles", because of that we should be more educated in approximately all the fields like policy, economic and cultures etc.
