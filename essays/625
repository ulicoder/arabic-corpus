Beginning with how I picked the story, I picked it randomly and now looking back at it this was a very big mistake. Now I know I have to read what I think I will pick before actually picking it because working on a presentation and analyzing and explaining needs passion about what you choose.
I was having a trouble with the story at the beginning because found it a little too explicit, and I was constantly thinking about how can we present it in a presentable way and be as professional as possible, I definitely was overthinking about it and it put me in a bad mood and a lot of stress, then I started accepting the fact that I chose this story by a mistake and I have to be responsible of my choice.
Me and my partner Aseel, we started thinking about a creative way to present this story, we wanted to impress and engage everyone and I think we did in a since.
I've learned a lot of this experience, first of all as I mentioned I will always read anything really well before I decide to go with it, I also now know that what you imagine in your head is completely different from what might really happen, I thought I will be knowing every single fact and detail about the 6 scenarios but I was wrong when me and Aseel started explaining and presenting to the class, ideas were flying out of my brain, and I did not remember a lot of the things I wanted to mention and talk about. This presentation defiantly expanded my view about presenting and preparing to a presentation in the future!
