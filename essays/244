Recently, e-books become broadly used. E-books are consider a valuable replacement to paper books. What renders e-books beneficial are many factors such as its environment impact, more flexible and less expensive than paper books. In this paper I intend to show the importance of e-books and its usage.
Unlike paper books you do not need to go to library or even to move from your desk to have the book you need which makes e-book more flexible than books.
Paper books have a detrimental environmental impact because of the many trees paper books need to create them.
In addition, according to PWC (2019) "that in 2018, e-book sales were higher than print book sales in US and UK" which shows that a large number of students do prefer to use e-books.
