The three articles were interested to me because they are talking about Instagram and things that happen a lot nowadays. But the most interested was “Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job” because it talks about how teenagers gain money sponsor Instagram it is refreshing to know that teens that have responsibility, have the ability to deal with business and they know how to mange their selves. I learned from the two other articles that not everything we see on social media is true because we only share our smiles not our sadness.
I think that “Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job” is the most researched and presenting the best evidence because it shows few people’s experiences and numbers and it proves conclusion.
