Usually, I used to feel cold in the bus even at summer. People sometimes overuse air conditioning in public places, such as, stores, offices, classrooms and so on. Some stores like to make people cold, thus they show themselves as a stately place. In this regard, Murphy (2015) said that being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores. But people will be affected negatively by that. The more the temperature is low people productivity will be less, as Hedge and Gaygen (2010) said that the optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that. But, maybe people that prefer low temperature in stores of everywhere. Tu sum up, air conditioner sometimes is good and overusing it will be bad for some people. Therefore, it is better to use it wisely.
