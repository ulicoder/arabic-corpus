Some people believe homework is important while others think that kids should rest and play after spending all day studying. As a teacher and a student, I believe that homework is important. Homework improves the student's memory, allows them to review and practice what has been covered in class and to get ready for the next day class. Furthermore, homework helps parents to communicate about what their children learning.
I also believe that students should not be given much homeworks, because they need time for playing and rest.
