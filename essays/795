Summer vacation is a two-months long vacation where kids stay at home and all schools are closed. Kids have enough time to play, read, enjoy and be part of any activity they couldn't join during the school year. They wait for summer vacation all year long because it is study-free period, no homework or assignment. It is the only time of the year that kids feel literally free from school.
Even though all of that is true, many parents and even educators believe that it is too long a break from school. They argue that summer vacation should be divided into several breaks through the year. In my opinion, as a parent and an educator, summer vacation is truly too long for both kids and parents. What is more, staying at home for long cause more home accidents caused by kids. In addition, kids who don't have open and safe places to play will spend hours using media or playing machines in order to kill time.
Overall, I believe that if we look closer we will find out that the disadvantages of a long break from school outweigh all advantages that could be mentioned. Thus, a great change should be taken into consideration regarding that issue.
