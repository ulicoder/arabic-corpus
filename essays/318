Some believe that the girls schools are better since girls would not compete boys or be intimidated by them.
However, I believe that the idea of single-sex school will reach a dead end. That is because girls and boys need to interact with each other for them to understand how each sex function and think. One cannot avoid competing or dealing with the other sex because at some point there will be males and females working together. Thus, both genders need to be exposed to each other from an early age, so that they would be aware of differences between them.
Once, I volunteered in a single-sex school in Jerusalem, and I got the chance to talk with some female students there. I asked them whether they are comfortable with such division and most of them were not satisfied. These answers included dissatisfaction about not having male friends, not being able to be in the same school with their cousins.
