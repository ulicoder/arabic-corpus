Most of the students find waking up at 7:00 to prepare to the school is very hard. I agree that schools should start the first lesson at 9:00 am, because students get late at going to sleep, so that effect at their waking.
Starting late has benefits on our students, they can come to school with full of energy. If they sleep well, they can focus more.
In my opinion as a student, every morning I find difficult at waking early to get started, also to arrive by bus. However, adding another hour to our sleep will help us to start our day actively.
Almost of students suffering from this problem, waking up early, sometimes it reflect on our education, because some student may hate school from waking up early.
At the end, I think we have to get start the school at 9:00 am for our sake, also for our future students to keep them love schools.
