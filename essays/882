Global concerns appears in the last years about the underrepresentation of women in sciences in general and particularly the physical, mathematical and computer sciences.
The way we raise girls are very different. Girls are more carful and they are more influenced by society. As a result of the pop culture we today expect scientist to look white or Asian male geek. This representation of this role effects girls, and therefore they avoid pursuing a career in the field. Moreover, teachers today are equal influenced by pop culture. They don't encourage girls to be part of the science studies. In such young age where hormones are raging it can be hard for girls to make decisions about their future, and they need the teacher to help them make the right choice, no the easy one.
In my opinion, increasing the participation of women in science requires requires change in both the educational system and social perceptions. Scientist should change the bad/incorrect publicity and increase their contact with children.
