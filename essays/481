Good teachers know how to bring out the best in their students.
I believe that every person has so many positive things inside him , some people just can take it out and show it but others just can't.
The person who can't show his positive things, it's because he didnâ€™t have the encourage from his family or his friends maybe or an accident that happened with him and changed something in him or his life and the big important thing in his second house - His school -the teachers in his school.
Students spend about 12 years at schools, with 7-8 hours a day, it's like a second house,
If the student didn't get the encourage from school, in my opinion it's the big and important part in their life, they won't succeed in anything.
A good and success teacher is not the teacher who has lots of information's, is not the teacher that pupils are scared from him, the teacher who studied abroad (at Oxford maybe).
Therefore, he is the best teacher!
I know that teachers must have a technique to teach, but every teacher must know that with every pupil you have to use different way, every pupil has its world you have to understand.
Good teacher is in the one hand, the teacher that pupils adore him and love his subject and in the other hand the one he know how to teach, he has the ability to teach.
In the end I want to say that every teacher must believe in every student, and cheers him.
As a teacher you should know a quote that says: "You can and you will!".
