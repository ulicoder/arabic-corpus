In recent years, people start to believe that all-girl schools are better for girls to learn in for a variety of reasons, such as the effect of boys on girls, since some girls feel intimidated by boys, and for the fact that in some places, boys get more attention than girls.
First of all, as it is believed, boys have a kind of a negative effect on girls, especially at middle- school ages, in where girls start to grow up and feel that they should get other gender attention, however, some girls at this age would lose a lot of their grades because of this effect.
Moreover, in some places, boys get more attention than girls, which would lead girls to think that it is not important for them to learn. In these places, parents only care about boys, and encourage them to learn, while they think that girls should only learn housekeeping.
Based on these reasons, and other reasons, people start to believe that all-girl schools are better for girls to learn.
