Tablets have taken over computers and laptops at work and textbooks in some schools, many schools are equipping pupils at schools with tablets in place of textbooks. Time is changing and is really important to analyze the way which fits this generation.
If tablets take the place of books the children do not have to carry the big bags full of different books. In addition the present generation of children is more attracted towards technology and they will openly learn the material on tablets and get better results, according Houghton Mifflin Harcourt study (2011) that showed how using iPads helped students to get higher scores in math. More than that, it will be more fun to learn and get the education on tablets, pupils will not feel like they are forced to study. It is also teaches students the latest technologies which will help to prepare them for a career upon graduation. For me as a teacher it is so important to cope the whole world of technology, the thing that prepares our student for the a digital future.
