As a first-year student, I would tell that it's very important for teachers to teach the subjects in an excellent way.
I'm telling this because I am seeing that it is very hard to absorb new information too fast by instructor that they take for granted that we are coming knowing the material that they want to teach.
I do not neglect the notion that the teacher has to be kind to its students, but never take care of teaching that students what it should be taught deeply.
I know that teaching isn't an easy job at all, and needs a lot of efforts and preparing. But I really wish that teachers take care of teaching the material as it should be. And while this being kind and not aggressive to students, to be patient and kind because in a way they are presenters of the subject they teach, if they are teaching in a creative way, students won't get bored even the material is too hard.
I prefer that teachers target students' difficulties and work on them, although, sometimes they don't have enough time to work on them, and have only time to pass the material they have according to the curriculum.
My experiences in life weren't really enough with teachers whom I really was influenced of, and even todays you can study by yourself at home without the need of the teacher, because the teacher is only gives an introduction to the material and then the students have to be able to deal with it.
Further, there might be some students who prefer frontal classes where they find it easier to gain new knowledge, and instructors may help them familiar with the material. It depends on everyone's attitude in learning.
