English language today became one of the most important language in the world. Not only adults need to use it in different fields but also children need it to play video games that they are addicted to nowadays,
Although my husband wanted me to continue learning nursing, I chose to learn English language and that was the turning point. I end the first year of nursing and start to learn English literature because I fond of it. I liked all of my English teachers in school and I decided to study it.
After I finished my B.Ed. I didn't practice it a lot and when I started to teach in my villages school I feel that I need to refresh the language and to improve. But the most important motive was that as a teacher, we don't have an opportunity to talk English inside the class and this is a serious problem. I find it difficult to talk in front of other teachers because I afraid to make any mistake. Recently, my friend encourage me to register with her to the M.A. degree and it was a great idea to review my English and to learn more advanced strategies that will be beneficial in my teaching process at school.
Therefore, I believe that keeping up the language need more effort and more courses especially writing. I hope I will enrich my lexical vocabulary and to reach my goals, talking fluently and writing in a suitable and right way as an academic.
