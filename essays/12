I believe that drivers shouldn't be given driving license under the age of eighteen from several reasons: first by this age they will be more mature and will be more aware of consequences of their actions. They can take responsibility of their lives and others. Second, I think they must go over some courses to show and teach them about dangers of risky driving and safe driving. They also need to learn to distinguish between right from wrong on road safety. In my point of view teenagers shouldn't drive under this age, in order for them to have better chance to behave right on road.
