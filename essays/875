The tool of communication in Instagram is mainly using pictures. People post pictures and share them with others. This app is highly addictive. Narcissism level related meaningfully to the amount of time people spend editing photos on Instagram (Sheldon and Bryant, 2016).
Personally, I have an account on Instagram and I think that Instagram is a good social media app because it helps people attain more costumers when having business. Moreover, I can communicate with old friends and know a lot of things about their life. Unlike the study of Dion (2016) who declares that a decline in our life satisfaction might started if people follow many celebrities on Instagram, I believe that following celebrities open the doors for people to see new details in celebrities life that can cause optimism or take a celebrity as a model.
Some people exaggerate and put too much pictures everyday, wherefore they waste their time, and that is a bad habit. Enjoying time using Instagram is common to find whatever we want on the accounts an buy them online. I buy games for my daughter on Instagram and I find it useful.
To conclude, sobriety is required when using Instagram, because using it to keep in touch with friends of advertising is acceptable. However, using it negatively in away that causes addiction is not preferable.
