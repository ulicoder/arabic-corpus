In most schools all around the world, students are the ones to be evaluated. Whether it be in terms of tests, homework, or even behaviors. These evaluations tend to frustrate students to a certain extent in which teachers or schools in general do not pay attention to. This frustration might cause students to feel less motivated, less interested in whatever materials that is being taught.
Thereby, schools should give students the chance to evaluate their teachers, this would be a good experience for both students and teachers. Which will result in mutual understanding on both sides. Normally teachers are the ones in control of everything that takes place in classrooms, that also indicates that when students are being evaluated their teachers are being evaluated in the same time with them, and that is because of the fact that whatever material they teach, or whatever attitudes they have towards the students will affect their outcome. Ultimately, that is why schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers so they can get the chance to be on the same side with their teachers, creating a better environment of understanding among both teachers and students.
