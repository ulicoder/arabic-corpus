i disagree with this statement because both are very important we cant renunciation on one of them if you want to be a good teacher u cant be an amazing one if you were just have an ability to relate to your students in a good way and and dont have an excellent knowledge of the subject you bieng taugh to your students thats will be good for you as a teacher.
if the teacher was have the enough and excellent knowledge that it can makes him to teach his studnts the materials that he have at a good way that they all can understand but if his way to relate with them was very bad, so that will not a very good to the teacher himself.
i think the important thing to the teachers is to be a good in their related to the students and to have a wide and excellent knowldege of the subjects that they taught in the class.
As we all know that the students all over the ages prefer to be with the teachers who care about them and show respect to his students that makes them very comfortable when they speak with thier speacial teacher, and if that teacher was have a wide knowledge they will be lucky to have a teacher like him with them, bcause he have the most two important features that the teacher should have, first relate well to the his students and second to have an excellenet knowledge of the subject being taugh.
at the end i would say if you dont have those two features so please dont call yourself as a teacher, because that very important to the student you cant just have one of them, so the teacher should have a balance with two features.
