I want to describe a nice thing I did for my friend. Last summer, I go with my friend to Spain to watch a match and in this day was my friend’s birthday. When we arrived to Spain we go to a hotel to take some comfortable and after this we well got ready to watch the mach. At the night, the time to match begin we go to the stadium surprise my friend has lost his ticket, however, my friend say to me: ”you watch the match and I will watch it in the TV “. Then I give my friend my ticket and say to him “this day is your day”. When we come back to the hotel, he go inside. The surprise was that the last friend who don’t go with us, come to Spain to celebrated in my friend’s birthday.
