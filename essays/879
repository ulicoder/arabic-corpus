Nowadays social media applications are attractive for many people. While other do not even use it or have it in their phones. To clarify old people do not know how to use Facebook or Instagram. On the other hand, as a young person I always use Instagram. It entertain me when I feel bored, I check my friends' last activities, I share pictures for the food I make and sometimes pictures for myself. I do not think that people put too much energy into the way they depict their lives through photos on Instagram because I believe that it is a part from their own daily lives and they got used to show what happens in their daily life on Instagram wether they share a photo or even put any regular post with a caption.
According to Sheldon and Bryant (2016) people who spends lots of time editing their photos for Instagram are self-centred and love theirselves so much, well I do not agree because I think that editing photos for Instagram is good because, you got positive comments in each photo and that makes you feel happy. Dion (2016) said that when people follow celebrities on Instagram they start to experience a decline in life satisfaction. Yet, I think it is not true and it depends on the person who follows celebrities and I follow celebrities to steal their outfits.
