Cellphones today are a major mean and an important tool to use during classrooms. There are lots of countries today that allow students to use their cellphones during the classroom. But in my point of view, cellphones are the most negative way to use during class.
First, students use their cellphones in class just for fun: they text each other, send messages, play games, even they may do a phone calls during the class.
Second, when students use cellphones they are distract and not focused. As a teacher I am not sure if they use their cellphones for the right purposes.
Third, and from my personal experience, students those days are so rude they might film or record a teacher while he or she teach, and they also might share those videos on the social networks.
Alternatively, I agree to use cellphones out of the classroom, they might do a home task using their cellphones. For example: I can build a task that/which is related to a lesson I taught/passed to my students and by that way I can check if they understood the material we had in class.
But, for me personally, I use my cellphone a lot, especially for learning purposes. Sometimes I share information or articles with my colleagues at work and we discuss these information. I also use my cellphones to enter final grades for students. I also might use it in order to be in touch with my lecturer in college via e-mails and so on.
For all the reasons I mentioned above, I am agree to use cellphones during classroom only when our students are aware for the aftermath of using cellphones in a negative way, and also only when our students are mature enough and know completely and exactly how to use their cellphones during the classroom.
