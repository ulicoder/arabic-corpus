Using cellphones as educational tools became a very important element for the teaching process, in and out of the classroom. As a teacher, I use the cellphone in classroom for many purposes, translating new words, googling new materials, looking for new ideas for better explanation. However, using the cellphones for the learning process is not useful as in the teaching process. Many studies have supported this point of view.
According to a survey by Tinder and Bohlander, the majority of the students who use cellphones in classroom, they use it for other purposes. It is hard for students to keep themselves away from texting messages, sending pictures, and using the social media websites. Although they can use cellphones for learning purposes.
Another study that support the idea that cellphones is not good for the learning process, it was conducted by Mendoza and Kim (2017). They found that students can perform better when they do not have cellphones. Student need to focus on their lectures and in performing well in their exams.
Cellphones can distract everybody from any work that must be done. Young and old people may be addicted to using cellphones. Cellphones became an important part of our lives. In one hand, we can use them to learn, get benefit and enrich our minds with many information (especially we can access them easily with the cellphones). In the other hand, we can use them for entertainment and waste our times. Everything has advantages and disadvantages in it. We must be aware of the way we use the things. As teacher we should lead the student of how to use cellphones for a better usage.
