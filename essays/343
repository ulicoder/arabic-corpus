Homework had been the most regular element kids were asked to do all through the education system history. At schools teachers have been giving pupils daily homework, whether they like it or not. In other words they have been some who enjoy this issue and some who are not.
Daily homework can be as a small task or maybe as a couple of question regarding the materials that were taught during the class.
In my opinion, it is too necessary to be giving a daily homework. I do support this because of many reasons; first, homework make kids be more responsible in that case if they were asked about materials during their classes, so this obeyed them to concentrate as well as possible, second homework can be helpful for improving the kids memory and the way of thinking by developing their own ideas and answers. Third, homework strongly help kids get really prepared and ready for the next class.
I highly and hardly agree with the issue of giving kids daily homework to submit online with such as a deadline of time, in this case they would have the full responsibility of taking this more seriously, not only but also they would have free time playing and organizing whatever they want in their free time during the rest of the day. In this way their life comes to be more "well organized" and they would have more plans to do in their free time.
In fact, this field of giving such daily homework to do teaches kids how being involved with improving questions that their were taught just the theoretical part at class and made them to large their thinking and express their own thinking.
In short, daily homework is too necessary for kids although they might be some disadvantages of it, but personally I'm always looking on the bright side of it which is totally beneficial.
