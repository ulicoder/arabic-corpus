Homework is vital part of learning, and it is expected by students, parents, school directors, and teachers. The benefits of homework are obvious: students retain class-taught language, they reinforce what they have learned, they develop study habits which ultimately allow them to develop as independent learners, and their cognitive understanding of language increases.
I think that homework is an important element for both students and teachers can use homework to monitor progress. In addition, homework is important because it is at the interaction between home and school, which means that homework is a connection between home home and school. Also there are several methods to make the homework fun for the students in order to cover both aspects of enjoyable and to make the student feel that they are happy with doing the homework, because for the students to commit their time to homework they need to see its value and students should be aware of why they are asking to do certain things.
To conclude, doing the homework after the school is an interaction progress between home and school, so it is important element, to develop.
