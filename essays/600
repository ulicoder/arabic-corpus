My classmate Bahjeh Isawe and I presented a short story called “The mouse” by Hector Hugh Munro-Saki. We collaborate with each other to do something special. We started our presentation with a summary of the story, in order to let the student know what is the subject and the content of the story. Then, we gave them a short background information about the author, after that we reviewed the story events, such as: the structure of the story, the main and minor characters, the setting, the theme and the conflict, we also choose a quote from the story and we analyze it to them to teach them how to read between the lines. In the end of the presentation, we did a small activity to make sure that they understood the story. We divide the class into four groups and each group got a question from the questions we formulated according to the story and the analysis we did. We gave them a few minutes to answer the questions and then we listened to their answers. The result was good as all the groups answered correctly. This means that we managed to convey for them what we wanted to deliver from analysis and information of the story. I enjoyed the experience I had made, the presentation that I presented and the story that I choose and prepared for my classmates. The questions which my classmate Bahjeh and I asked for the classmates had led me to realize that I did achieve my goal, I was more than grateful and it made me feel relieved and content. That was the first time I actually taught a bunch of students a story that I have prepared by myself. I was confident and quite sure that I approached them the right way. I like this experience so much; I learned a lot from it, such as, new vocabulary, new expressions and how to analyze the story. I planed on working on myself to become a teacher that students can believe in, trust and rely on.
