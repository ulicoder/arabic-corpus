"Never stop learning for when we stop learning we stop growing", this quote is very meaningful for me and has impacts on my thoughts. I decided to continue my Academic studying and have M.A. degree to enrich my information about language and full my brain with new. As an English teacher who delayed studying for M.A. many years, I took a moment to think about myself after a lot of circumstances that made me put my studying journey aside and deal with. I thought about my future and how I should make something about it. So I ignored every thing and planned to have step ahead.
I think this is the time to improve myself as a teach to have more powers to give for my students. One of my biggest goals is to make my students more creators and teach them with more efficient way. Studying for my M.A. program helps me to come closer to my dream which is having a doctorate degree. My kids have to see their mother as a model, I want to give them the hope to reach whatever they want. I expect this year to be a year full of successful moments because I am doing something that I love. Also I expect a support from my family to complete my studying without obstacles.
