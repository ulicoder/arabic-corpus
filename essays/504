Humans life had a revaluation of the globalization and metropolitan, which is our life is about shopping in malls and various food and sports centers. Humans have a lot of ways to get himself out of stress and to enjoy. So I agree with the young people enjoy life more than older people do.
I will begin with adolescence nowadays, that there are live a life which allows them to explore and to learn. Now there are a lot of new technology that appears such as social media, phones, computers and etc. which we can call it a useful option where they can hang out with friends any time and to communicate with them any time. So all of these are new and development things that older people can see as a strange or a curse that they will have a difficult to learn it or use it.
Young people attendance is close to adventurous and they life to have an extreme sport just as skating, gym, soccer or any other sport that were not possible for older people. Which this sports are more fun and more interesting than the games that older people like such as chessâ€¦
Moreover, young people have much enthusiasm than the older people ages. Which they want to enjoy life and have every second and every minute in their life. Young people know that their life is ahead of them, this is why they are eager to do everything that make them happy and to experience new activities throughout their lives. While older people that see themselves out of time and feel weak.
To conclude, I convinced that technology and development of our life made a lot of changes and a lot of entertainment for younger people to have an enjoyable life.
