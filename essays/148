As a matter, I am very upset at the way video games use swearing and curse words. My kid spends a lot of time watching and playing video games and he starts to use bad words in his real life. I think he doesn't realize that these words are not appropriate. Moreover, he doesn't know their meaning. I try to react calmly and ignore what he says, but sometimes I become yelling or punishing him.
