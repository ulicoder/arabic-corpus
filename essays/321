Schools are the first source of education we get. From kindergarten to 12th class, we go to school every day starting from 8 am and ending at approximately 2 pm. Teachers usually complain about the students passivity in the first two sessions.
Starting a school day at 10 am instead might have several positive effects. For instance, student would be more alert, comprehend the material that is being taught and as a result have better achievements.
In addition, student go home at about 2 am, and start doing their homework, and the end of the day they wouldn't find time for their personal space because they need to sleep early.
I still remember how hard it was to concentrate when I was at high school when I am tired and sleepy.
So, even for me as a future teacher who at that time would probably have a baby, it would be much more comfortable and supportive.
