Primarily, single-gender school focuses on improving the educational experience. It is believe that when girls study apart from boys their academic achievements improves. Usually, men or boys get most of the educator attention which doesn't leave much space for female individual to stand out. We can take into consideration the fact that many cultures don't expect women to be well educated. In addition, girls are less confident that boys when it comes to speaking their mind and they are more sensitive to making mistakes, especially in the presence of the opposite sex.
Approximately all girls feel certain amount of pressure in the presence of the opposite sex that is why in my opinion single-gender sex is a good idea. It takes some of the pressure of and they can concentrate better without thinking about the male peers in the classroom.
