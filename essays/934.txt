Foreign language, is a language that is belonging to, or connected with a country that is not your own. We can learn a foreign language in different ways, such as: studying on your own, taking lessons with a private tutor, taking lessons as part of a class, taking lessons online, and going to live in a country where the language is spoken. People study a foreign language for different reasons and in different ways. I prefer to study the language in more that one way. Firstly, taking lessons as a part of class, to get know the language rules, structures and to learn everything that I have to learn. Studying the language in this way, will not help me with acquiring the language as much as possible. That is why I will add some online lessons. Taking lessons online will give me the chance to talk with native speakers which going to help me with acquiring the language, but this way will not help me with studying the grammar or the basics of the language. That is why I need to study the language in the class.
The last thing I would like to do for making my language better, is going to live in a country where the language is spoken. This way will improve my language and my accent, and will let me get use to the language.
