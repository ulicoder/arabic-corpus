Nowadays, being able to speak a foreign language has become very important. It opens various job opportunities, and it could be very helpful with traveling. People learn languages using various methods: studying on their own, taking lessons with a private tutor, taking lessons as part of a class, taking lessons online, and going to live in a country where the language is spoken. In this essay, I am going to discuss some of these methods according to my personal experience and belief.
A few years ago, I tried learning Korean on my own. At first, this method worked well for me; I studied at my own pace, and was able to pay more attention to the aspect of the language that interested me such as, spelling. However, at some point I felt stuck and in need of some guidance.
Moreover, I also experienced studying as part of a class. This method, obviously, had the advantage of having a teacher, However, the teacher's attention was divided, and the topics being taught were chosen by the teacher. Furthermore, I also took lessons with a private tutor. This method worked the best for me. The tutor helped me study at my own pace, and the topics being taught were suitable to my level and interest. However, I faced a few problems with arranging appointments that are suitable for both the tutor and me.
Although I have not tried taking lessons online or going to live in a foreign country, I could think of a few advantages and disadvantages for both methods. First, taking lessons online could be boring, and the lessons may not be suitable for the student's level. In addition, the students are only able to watch pre-recorded videos with little opportunity to interact. However, going to live in a country where the language is spoken offer various interaction opportunities, but I think that it is not practical. In conclusion, I think that the best method for learning a foreign language is a mixture of self-study and taking lessons with a private tutor.
