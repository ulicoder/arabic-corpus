A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I agree with statement and that's refer for many reasons I see all right.
First of all, when teacher goes to new class, he must be assertive but in good way its means that teacher have to put some of rules talks about the allowed behavior in the class, after that he can keep the management and the students know their limit. So every students know how to treat with his class and with his teacher in this way we can reduce the problems in the class between all of the students and that help them to get more information in this way.
Secondly, after he do that, now he should do conversation with the class to be aware about the ability for each students, I think this will help the students to be closer to the teacher and they can trust him so the teacher must to be good listener. According to this when teacher care about his students, how they feel in the class, to let them express their opinion this will help them in understanding the material and to love what they do because they like the teacher and his way in passing the lessons.
Finally, because of this reasons I think that a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important. And that's gives the students high self confident and they been good learners for this lessons.
