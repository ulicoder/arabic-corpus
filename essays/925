There are variable ways for learning a foreign language. Each way has both advantages and disadvantages. However, I will present three ways: studying on your own, taking lessons as a part of a class and going to live in a country where the language is spoken.
Studying on your own is an important method for independent learners. It is more effective for them. They can, simply, choose the most suitable place and time for their learning process. They can also put more emphasis on the subjects that achieve their goals. On the other hand, they are less connected with people. In addition, those independent learners would face difficulties practising the language.
Taking lessons as part of a class is very efficient way for learning from others. Firstly, those learners will have teachers who can correct their mistakes. Secondly, they can ask help from their peers. Lastly, they can get a certificate that officially states their success. However, this way is not suitable fro people who are limited on time or money.
Going to live in a country where the language is spoken offers a fast and efficient way for acquiring a language. It helps learners acquiring the informal and the communicative language. It helps learners use terms and metaphors correctly. Moreover, it helps learners pronounce words just like the mother tongue speakers. Still, they will face problems during writing and dictating.
To sum up, learners can decide the suitable way for their needs.
