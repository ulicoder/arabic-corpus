A teacher's ability to relate well with students is not more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, teachers have to do their job perfectly, on one hand they need to know how to contact with the students and respect them, believe in them and their abilities, however on other hand they need to recieve the required material to the students, that's why they are called teachers, they are teachers and their job is to teach.
Teachers are supposed to share their knowledge with the students and guide them, support them by giving them different methods in how to use the material and deal with it, learn them new ways to use their skills and to show their abilities, being a good teacher who cares for her students and want to invest in them and to cause them success in their lives. It's not enough in order to become an brilliant teacher who wants to get out the best of her students and wants to reach the top should do her job first if all so she will feel comfortable because she did her maximum, then it's depends on the students themselves, how they are going to use it and study it, the teacher's job is to define their strength and weakness if she gave them messing material its will be her false that some of the students failed then she can't judge them and divide the class in to sections by levels, also she will start blaming herself for not giving her best, but when she is confident, when she is satisfied of her self and her job she can do that simply that's why, teachers should do both, everything in life causes specific result to acquire intelligence in our education system we should focus on this points.
