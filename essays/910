When I decided to study my MA program I was very afraid to do this step because everyone knows that this step is very important and motivating to reach to the top of learning. I entered this program to know what new about teaching, and how to deal with my students in literature and to know many ways to teach it in my school. This step is very important for me because I want to continue my education to know more and more.
My goals in this two years to reach for a good marks as well as to continue to PhD education. I love English very much because when I was in high school my teacher told me that you will be a great teacher in the future, and now I am an English teacher in Ablien with BA and I started now to continue my education to MA and then to PhD, so my expectations about this two years that I will study many things that will help me in my teaching, and I will get many techniques, so when I finish my MA I hope to deal with my teaching very well, and I will know how to continue without make any mistakes. I have many goals and expectation, so I need to achieve it all.
Finally I hope to succeed in this program to make my family and especially my husband to be proud of me all the time.
