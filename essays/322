Women earn computer science degrees less than men. In 2010 for example 18% females graduated from computer-science department while in 1985 it was 37%.
This could be because of the growing numbers of workers in that field which could lead to unemployment. Women are usually more concerned with their job and more serious about it, so to avoid cases where they do not find jobs, they would study other subjects.
Another reason could be the working conditions that accompany the job of computer science. Women would prefer a job with less hours, less complicated work, and ends whenever she leaves the workplace.
According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, women do not pursue in computer and tech fields because they might not be encouraged as often as boys. I believe in our days that wouldn't be a problem, since females are more independent than ever and they wouldn't necessarily need others encouragements, or someone to decide for them.
