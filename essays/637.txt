The chance to analyze a short story was so beneficial. When I start reading the story for the first time I felt like I am lost, I was not sure that I could do all the things that I should do.
I started reading while thinking about the questions in the same time this thing prevent me to feel the beauty of the story, I wanted just to finish it and to solve the questions as soon as I can because our time was limited.
After the first reading, I tried to solve the first question but I did not do that because I just read and I did not understand it.
Therefore, Adan and I decided to work together and not to divide the questions and everyone to solve part of them. We started to work together; I explain things to her and she also, the group work help me accept and know a new ideas that I was not aware for.
We read the story many times and after every question, we read it one more time, every time we read the story there were another purpose for the reading.
We search information from the internet and we found it was helpful but not the whole information, we preferred to write our ideas and thoughts and to paraphrase it in the suitable way that help the audience to understand it.
We faced the time problem we work very hard to make our presentation perfect and full of benefit informations.
