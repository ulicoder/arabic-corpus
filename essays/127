I think that giving students the ability a evaluate teachers is wrong. First, students are not responsible. Their age doesn't allow them to evaluate the teacher objectively, they tend to mix their feelings with their opinion.
Second, students don't really know what is best for them. They think that the serious teacher, the one who gives homework and thinks carefully before wasting any minute of the class is bad. While, the teacher who keeps laughing with them, the one who is lenient and not very tough is actually the best teacher ever. They don't think beyond what is happening during the lesson, they are very limited and narrow-minded.
Third, students who do a minimal effort or class usually don't get high marks. They say that it is not their fault, it is the teacher's fault all the time. When these students are given the opportunity to evaluate a teacher, they tend to revenge. And that is not ethical and fair at all. All in all, I don't recommend using students' evaluation or giving it any importance because only a very small percentage of them are true and authentic.
