The fast food is a local food of all over the world. It has been suggested that fast food restaurants should be banned in the vicinity of schools, and now I will show my opinion about this case.
On the one hand the fast food is a local food and the most the people especially the students love this food and they are the highest customers of it. For that most students will disagree this ban and prefer to eat the fast food on their schools.
On the other hand, eating a lot of fast food will make a damage on the health of the students. For that the parents and also the teachers will prefer to make this ban real and agree on it.
In the end I want to say that there are many benefits and damages of the fast food in different aspects like economic aspect and all the people have to think about this suggestion and they make the decision after a lot thinking with taking considerations of all the benefits and damages of the fast food.
