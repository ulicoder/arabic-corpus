Most of the people may think that young people are likely to enjoy life more than older people do, because young people are healthier, able to do many deeds that older people can't do, have more opportunities in their life and so on. However, there are many old people in the world who believe that they had finished their hardest part of life with working hard, and now they can relax and have time for rest. So, I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
Even though, old people are more likely to have diseases and a lot of free time that make them bored, there are several reasons to be happier than younger ones. First, they can feel less responsible because they don't have to work and many people assist them. Second, they can do many activities like traveling around the world and enjoy because of their leisure.
For example, while the young people are studying or concerned about studying, are working or concerned about working, older people are setting at their homes and don't have to do something, relax and are enjoying their time with their family.
