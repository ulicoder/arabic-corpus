With each year passes by, more and more women are seeking education in different fields however according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology "women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in US down from 37% in 1985". Therefore in this paper I intend to discuss the possible reasons to this decline.
Dr. Cheryan claims that the decline is a result of pop culture portrayals of scientists in shows like "Revenge of the Nerds" and "Big Bang Theory". However, there have been many TV shows that linked different jobs with negative points but until now people and girls still pursue those careers. For example, even though nursing is portrayed as a feminine job in different cultures there are many males who work as nurses.
Moreover, analysts say the reason to the decline could be because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as much as boys are. Parents and the people surrounding girls could have the biggest effect on girls. For example. most Arabic parents encourage their daughters to pursue jobs with good working hours so that they would have enough time to take care of their household. Moreover some girls might disqualify different jobs because it is dominated by males.
In conclusion, people get affected by the options of those around them specially in a crucial time such as selecting future occupation. People tend to hear to the experiences of those around them and make a safe decision regarding choosing their next step in life.
