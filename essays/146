I think school isn't only a place where children are educated. In addition of getting educated, they deal with different social skills. such as sharing, being independent and getting self-confident.Schools prepare a member in the society. Those children will go to college or workplace they will be surrounded by females and males, because of that I don't agree with single-sex school. It minimizes the communication skill with whole society. Females and males together force a lot of communication problems and that raises the tension between them which leads to destroy the basics of the society.
