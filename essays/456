Good teachers know how to bring out the best in their students.
A good teacher know how to bring out the best in their students in many ways, and each teacher do it by his own way.
Being a teacher is not an easy thing to do, because when you are a teacher, you will face many students, which are different from each other by many ways, like their way to learn and accept new information, their way to do things, and their own talents, but a good teacher knows how to bring the best in his students, and to make them better people, by knowing themselves better.
In my opinion, I think that for being a good teacher and to bring out the best in your students, you should learn to bring out the best in yourself first, then you should be closer to your students, so you could understand them better, then you have to talk to them about things that they like, you donâ€™t have to talk about school and exams every lesson, you can make some time for your students, and to treat them like your friends, cause when the student feel that he is understood and that he can do another things at school not just studying will give his best at exams and lessons, (from a personal experiment).
At conclusion, I think that a good teacher can bring out the best in his student by his own way, and students will like being understood, so if they were treated well and if they were understood they will give their bests for sure.
