I think that the number of students in class affects how well teachers can teach and students can learn. Number of students per teacher is generally associated with class size and I believe that smaller classes provide a better teaching and learning. Teaching small group or a small number of students is easier for the teacher and in this way the teacher can pay attention to all the students.
