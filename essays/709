In recent times, the number of car accidents has increased especially in the city center. As a result there is growing concern of the influence of this phenomenon on people.
Firstly, a lot of cars in the city center will cause an annoyance to the citizens. In extreme cases having too many cars in the area will make many problems in hearing and sometimes cause deafness to newborn babies.
Secondly, banning cars from entering the city center will reduce the traffic and people will start using other kinds of transportations like the bus, and that will decrease the pollution in our environment. So if everyone of us tries to use another transportation he or she would help our society in having fresh air.
In conclusion, the new policy of banning cars from entering the city center will help improve many problems and this policy will end up with positive effects on our society.
