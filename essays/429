In the Filter Bubble article the narrator discussed the fact of the "Algorithms" which transcribes the things we are facing on many websites.
The Filter Bubble is mainly a search engine that depicts some information that we investigate whether if we do so from our computers or our phones. This system tries to estimates our following "search". Each time we will look for a topic on Google; as was mentioned in the article - sharing an article about cooking on ABC news you may be chased around the web by ads for Teflon-coated pots. Yes, it is so dangerous!
In fact, this systemÂ entices you to be isolated and not to use any search.
In my opinion, the Filter Bubble is problematic and extremely critical because it works on keeping people from a whole world filled with so interesting experiences into a small world full of disabilities.
