In my opinion is that the ability to relate well with students is not more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Because if the teacher don't have the good knowledge in his own subject, he can't deliver the material to the students and this is a real problem. If the teacher can't connects to the desired result then there is no need for him to be in class, because we call the teacher, "a teacher" not because he is cute and have the ability to relate well with students, we call him that because he knows more than the students who set in class to learn from the excellent knowledge he has. What I mentioned before doesn't mean that the teacher don't need to have the ability to relate well with students, it is really an important thing and usually those are the loved teachers. But that doesn't mean that they don't need to have the excellent knowledge in the subject they being taught.
