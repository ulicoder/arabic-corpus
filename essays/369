I found that the article  "Posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" is interesting because it talks about the social media "Instagram" because I am one of the people that active and related every day to the Instagram, it's show us many experiences of the people especially the teens and sometimes it shows us direct daily activities to the people of our age and another, and I add of this we can make many from several programs on the Instagram as example if you had many followers you can get money and when you share photos to Brand you will get more and more money. Also, Instagram is saving all our picture and our activities, parties for many years.
I like to use the Instagram as a job in the summer when everyone works hard outside of their homes and get tired, I can post in the Instagram and use it as a job and get money in my home, in the time that I need and I won't get tired.
The most researched and presenting the best evidence article to me was also  "Posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" because it shows what the people do it their lives and their experiences.
