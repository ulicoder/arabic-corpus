Enjoying life has always been a controversial issue. Some people claim that older people enjoy life more than younger people do. However, I donâ€™t really agree with this statement.
I believe that it depends to the person himself, and to the way he lives.
Maybe some of us will think that young people are one step ahead of older people when the subject is "enjoying life" because older people may take the life more seriously and they are aware of things that the young people still think it's an adventures. Or even because they have less responsibilities than the older people. In addition, young people are filled with more energies and ambitions toward life while older people is less interested and excited for life.
And in the other hand, some of us think that older people are enjoy life more than younger people do because they already finished the "hard work" in life, like working, studying and so on. And they right now enjoying some other things. Or they have a lot of leisure so they can do many activities such as traveling and exploring the world, reading books, sewing, and flower arranging.
In conclusion, I believe that the reasons that I mentioned previously is not really convincing. Because no matter how old we are, we should love our selves first and our life second in the way it is and to live always happily and with a lot of satisfaction because the happiest persons are not the ones who is young and old or have a lot of money, things, friends, health or even love, but the ones who focusing on loving their lives without giving any attention to the age.
