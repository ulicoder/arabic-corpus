Interest increased about if tablet computers become the primary way that students learn in class, as a classwork, assignments and educational activities and if this technology will interest students more than the traditional way of teaching without technology but with textbooks.
Some learners like to use tablets for education purposes and they enjoy utilize it but they prefer to use tablets. In this regard, Singer and Alexander (2016) found that school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbooks.
In contrast, using technology is helpful for education purposes, according to a study by Houghton (2011), showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional textbooks.
To sum up, technology may be useful and beneficial for education goals, but in contrast of that it may be fault to use it in education, therefore, it depends on how we use it as learners.
