Five years ago, we traveled to aqaba in Jordan.their we visited so many places especially the Petra. Petra is one of the most seven amazing places in the world, it was a very nice experience,the hotel was very big and awesome, it has over five pools and playing places for childrens, we visited the biggist mall in Aqapa, it has over six floors, their I bied my first playstation it was vary happy, this trip was one of the best trips for me. I hope that I can visit Jordan again.
