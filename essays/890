Each new school year brings new expectations and challenges to both pupils and teachers. Assigning homework is an inseparable part of the school's daily life, and pupils are given homework almost everyday. Some pupils do not take homework seriously. However, others take it seriously believing that doing homework actually means practicing different skills and thus succeeding in school work.
In my opinion, and according to my own experience in the field of education, I see homework as a great tool for learning and acquiring skills if it is designed in an effective way.
For example, homework should be given after teaching the material for a long period of time and not on material that has been just taught. This way pupils practice their knowledge on something they already understand in depth and are able to do it more successfully.
On the other hand, homework should not be given for the sake of giving homework, because pupils spend the majority of their day at school, going from one class to the other and from one teacher to a different one. At the end of the school day, they feel extremely tired with the burden of new material taught. They need a break from it all. That is why it is not always a good way to assign more home work. School pupils should be given the time to be involved more in community work rather than school work only.
Balance is the key word here. Homework should be given only when it is necessary and beneficial for the development of the pupils. Otherwise, new materials should be practised during class time together with the teacher.
