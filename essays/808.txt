Tower of Babel
The Tower of Babel is a myth. This myth explains how language came to be and how different people from different places speak different languages.
According to the story, a god taught the human race to speak a language, the language of the gods. All people around the world spoke the same language. With time humans became very ambitus and decided to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven so they can be gods.
The god did not like what the humans were up too and he got very upset. They misused his gift. Therefore he decided to destroy their city and tower. In addition, he decided that the human race will not speak his language and therefore he confounded their speech so they will not be able to understand each other and communicate. Then he scattered them around the world.
Although this is a myth, I do believe that some greater power is responsible for our ability to speak. It is true that we as humans are different from animals because we have the ability to produce various sounds and talk about things that do not exist. Being able to develop a language has to do with more than just brain functioning.
Having a god, teaching or blessing humans with a language makes more scene to me than any other theory.
As a believer that the world was created in an instant, controlled by a higher power, by something that we are not able to comprehend. I do believe that we are part of his greater plan.
Maybe humans in the past did upset the god and he made us so different that even today when we as educators try to teach the next generations to accept others and be open to the "different" and "strange" we are not capable to fulfill this quest. Maybe the god made us so different that we will never be able to overcome this barrier and he wants us to stay different and not feel belonging.
