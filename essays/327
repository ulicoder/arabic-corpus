Homework is needed to some extent. This means that kids should not be overflooded with homework and not having no homework to do. The reason for not flooding the kids with homework is that they need to rest and meet their families after a long day at school. Also, the parents aren't able to work another shift after working outside home and then to go back to teach their kids which could be considered another work, but rather they are supposed to rest and have quality time with their kids. This means that having homework after school will kill this quality time and turn the kids and the parents into machines.
Now, the reason for giving simple homework is that the kids keep following up with their teachers which means that they don't get lost and if they have things to make up, they can as their parents could see what their kids are studying at school and if they have specific questions or difficulties. So they can approach their home class teacher and ask them what aids their children can have.
