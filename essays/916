While we enter most schools nowadays we realize that the schools are mixed-gender, which means girls and boys learning together in the same classes. Even though there are people who call for single-gender schools, I don't think this is a good idea.
Females today get more popularity in classes than boys, they have better grades, they are more discipline and they focus more on their learning that boys who get distracted by the outside world. As for the statistics that say that boys get more attention than girls, I find this entirely untrue because due to my personal experience as a teacher, I don't differentiate between genders during my lesson, on the contrary girls get higher marks and are more serious than boys when it comes to the issue of education. So I think that single-gender schools doesn't answer this concern that boys gain more popularity over girls. As teachers we should raise more awareness that both genders are treated equally in school and get the same education regardless of their background.
