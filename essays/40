Some people believe that girls learn better when they aren't competing with or intimidated by boys. This belief lead to the increase of the all-girls schools popularity. Personally, I disagree with the idea of single-sex schools.
I do not believe that all-girls school are exempt of competition and intimidation. Even in all-girls school there will always be some kind of competition among students. In addition, even if girls were not intimidated by boys, they may be intimidated by other girls.Furthermore, boys do not necessarily get more attention than girls because of their gender. A person draw other's attentions by his actions.
I also believe that all-girls schools will have a negative effect on the girls social lives. By only communicating with other girls, girls may not be able to communicate with boys. I think that they will feel intimidated and will not be able to express their opinion clearly to boys.
To sum up, everything in life has pros and cons. However, regarding the idea of having all-girls schools I believe that there are more cons than pros. Therefore, I do not support having all-girls schools.
