Tablets are becoming very powerful nowadays. A tablet is like mini computer that has applications, camera, games, music, and many more. Recently, many schools replaced the traditional books with electronic tablets. According to Singer and Alexander (2016), tablets are more enjoyable among school students.
However, students learn more effectively when using hard copies. Most children are familiar with technology and enjoy using it in their daily life, whether by playing games, listening to music or using different apps. So it is very natural to them to take technology back to school with them. Another study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) revealed that there is an 20% increase in math test. However, tablets are more expensive than buying books and are easy to break, especially when it is used by small children. Furthermore, students can be easily distracted when using tablets along with the different applications and games. In addition, spending a lot of time in front of the screen may cause harmful health issues such as headaches, red eyes, and tired muscles. In short, using tablets in schools maybe very effective and enjoyable for students. Nevertheless it may cause severe health problems.
