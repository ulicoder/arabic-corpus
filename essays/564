I agree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject it self being taught.
If a teacher can understand her or his student well that would lead to solve many problems, if a teacher does not understand a student or lets say does not try to understand that will not be useful for any subject that she or he might teach. It all somehow starts with understanding, with better understanding you'd get better results, with better understanding you'd be able to perform better. By that teachers would be accomplishing their mission with the students gaining all the knowledge and information they need.
If a teacher is teaching grammar for instance she or he has to make the students understand everything she's saying, if she does not and the students miss a point or two they'd probably feel lost and as we all now most students do not look forward to grammar lessons doesn't matter in which subject it is, whether its English, Arabic or Hebrew.
So in order to pass the information correctly or to give them the best amount of knowledge that is needed a teacher has to find a way to make it work somehow, make grammar a bit more interesting now in order to do that there has to be some kind of relation between the teacher and the student, some kind of bond that could actually be helpful for the teacher and the student, therefore a teacher's ability to relate well to student is way more important than providing the excellent knowledge, because in order to pass information to students a teacher is going to have the ability to relate to them.
