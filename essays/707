The technology is developing, and most of people have cars. So, there always crowded in city center. Actually I hate traffic cars so I with this decision of banning cars from entering the city center.
Firstly, as I said in the previous paragraph that most people have cars, they cause air pollution when the gas is released from the cars, and that influences on people.
Secondly, too much cars in the city center will affect on people and on the earth and on atmosphere (the ozone layer). This is not good for humans.
Endly, we have to reduce from cars in our life, to make life healthier.
