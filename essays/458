When I was in high school, I had an amazing English teacher that actually affected my whole idea about teaching. I did not like the idea of being a teacher; however, when she taught me she gave me that feeling that teachers can change one's life. Therefore, from that point I started to plan and dream about affecting people lives. I am that kind of person that like to spread people all over the world, and this could be my first step toward that dream.
I wanted to study English so bad that I signed for many colleges and universities. I was accepted eventually at Gordon College, and I actually study there now. I did not finish my year yet. I want to move from Gordon to this college because I believe that I am going to be happier here. In other words, I do not feel belonging there; it was a little bit hard for me to communicate and enjoy, although I tried hard, I always had the feeling that I am a minority.
I believe that I deserve to be happy with the subject that I am studying; therefore, I hope that moving to this college would make difference. I am in the process of achieving my dream, and I need to be happy and proud of what I am doing.
