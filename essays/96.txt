All of my classes that I teach are too small for the big amount of students in each class. There are thirty students with different levels in the same class, and it is too difficult for me to deal with these individual differences.
In each class we have students with different learning styles and some of them with learning and physical disabilities and also we have gifted students. Therefore I believe that we should divide students into small groups according to their levels and their learning styles, this will lead to a successful teaching experience. Students will have the opportunity to learn in a comfortable environment that provides them with the things that they need and facilitate the process of teaching for them.
