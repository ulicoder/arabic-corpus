Some people claim that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers, while others claim the opposite. I believe that students should be given the opportunity to speak up, express their opinion, and play a serious role as students; therefore, to participate in that democratical experience and to assess their teachers. Those who support giving the student the opportunity to evaluate their teachers states that the evaluation process does not have to depend on the principal, teachers or the education minister, but also students should take part in that process.
