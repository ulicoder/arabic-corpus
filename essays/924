Learning a foreign language is not easy for me and for other learners. It has very difficulties. First, studying on your own, second, going to live in a country where the language is spoken, third, taking lessons as a part of a class.
Studying in your own is very important way for the learners. That is, the learners can learn and they can depend about themselves to learn the knowledge. Moreover, studying on your own gives you to believe in your abilities, that you can succeed to learn alone. The disadvantage is that you don't know if you walk in a correct way or not.
Going to live in a country where the language is spoken is ver effective for the learners. The learners can practice their language when they live there. Mixing the native speakers are very useful for the learners. The will know the right pronounce because they have to talk to each other just in their language. For example, about myself, there are some words, that I can not pronounce them as a native speaker. As a learner you have to live in the country where the language is spoken to be able to consider the language correctly. Disadvantage of this way is, to leave your family and your friends.
Taking lessons as part of a class is good. That is, the learners can listen to a native speaker which will help them to hear the correct pronounce. The disadvantage of this way is that the teacher does not have a time to speak with the learners after the class. I prefer to go to live in a country where the language is spoken.
