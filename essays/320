Evaluations should be very important, especially if it is critical and objective. Students of colleges and universities do evaluate their pictures for development reasons. I also believe that school teachers should also be evaluated, and students should be heard.
Teachers needs to be updated with how they perform. Sometimes, a teacher might not be able to tell about his/her methods of teaching. That is if their methods suits the pupils or not.
In addition, evaluation could either strengthen or weaken the teacher. So, if students have positive attitude towards the teacher that could boost the teacher and motivate him or her to perform better while if the teacher sees that students are not comfortable with their way of teaching, then they could improve and suits new methodology for their student to feel better and understand. Once in my second year in the English track, my class and I had a serious problem with the way a certain doctor taught, so when we wrote the evaluation we got the chance to be heard and after that the lecturer seem to have a serious issue with her/his methodology and she/he got fired.
