Inappropriate language in schools, even in primary classes, is on the rise. Students use bad words in order to express their anger and their bad feelings.
This language is not tolerated in school. Teachers' options are limited, but perhaps they don't need many options at all. The best thing a teacher can do is approach the swearing student, with firmness and respect, that those words are not allowed to be used in school.
Personally I think that the most powerful way to reduce the negative trends of student language is to create a culture of positive language usage.
