The issue that was discussed by both research, first of the National Center for Women and Information Technology and second by Dr. Cheryan which is the number of women in computing and tech fields that is 18% in 2010 according to the National Centre. In addition, each research mentions the reasons for this phenomenon. In USA analysts say that girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys. In my opinion that is true. I believe that on one hand, parents don't educate their daughters to be skilful in technology or science. Parents raise their daughters to be good at languages or literature. On the other hand, parents educated their sons to be skilful in tech and computing since they are babies. They give sons toys that demand thinking and analyzing, however parents give daughter toys of dolls or kitchen stuff. I encountered that this phenomenon is not new. People continue in treating females in the same style as before 30-40 years ago.There is no progress in educating girls according to the technology development in the world. Nevertheless if there is a progress it is not great, due to the fact that when girls who have diplomas from Technion or other technological institution get married and have families most of them change jobs and work as teachers or nurses.
In my opinion, society including teachers, parents, old people, in addition the movie-makers subjectively don't encourage females to enter the tech fields, in general. Still, when girls enter the field, people may tell her this field is not for her and she should work as a teacher or nurse, because these jobs are appropriate for females.
For conclusion, I encountered that society should start encouraging girls to enter the tech field more and more. In addition society must give girls a chance of equality not to treat them as weak member especially teachers, teachers should encourage girls to study computing or work in computing companies.
