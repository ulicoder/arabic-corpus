When I grow up I plan to study medicine because it is the best job in the world.
I am at high school now and it is not easy to earn high points in the bagrut. My major at school is electronics â€“ I should have majored in biology but a year ago I was planning to study engineering. Now I am interested in medicine. Anyway I will have to supplement many subjects in the Technicon before applying for medicine.
Anyway, I will have to wait another two years before I decide on a subject.
