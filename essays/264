Once used only for making calls, now in a tool with which one uses to do everything but calling.
Cellphones turned to be into smartphones, that include various apps, from games to communication apps such as messenger, and WhatsApp. Taking this matter into account, shows the fact that the general public prefers texting to calling.
Furthermore, RIT researchers studied this issues, on texting versus calling, they concluded that participants tend to dislike the fact that when calling, they have to immediately reply, and the fact that they have to do "the small talk" conversation" due to the fact, that when calling one has to be a bit more formal than with texting, for instance, cannot skip the "hi, how are you?" part.
I can relate to this matter, owing to those causes listed above, and that is because I tend to use texting more often than calling. I use calling only when there is something urgent to be said. One can easily assume that in a few years from now it will even get worst, smartphones keep improving, and developing which makes the whole issues of texting vs. calling a bit more complicated than it should be. Smartphones have already taken over many peoples' lives, which contributed to the lack of "real" face-to-face communication. Due to these facts, people should concentrate more on real communication rather than paying so much attention to texting.
