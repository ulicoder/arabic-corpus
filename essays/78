Many years ago we were not used to hear about boys and girls learning together at the same school. Our schools used to separate them and never let them study together.
In addition, the number of girls that went to school in the past was larger. People used to believe that girls more sensitive than boys, calm and able to concentrate more. However, in my opinion, they don't have the chance to communicate and to deal with real life situations with boys. Socially, both sex will face difficulties in their experience of life and will have problems in dealing with social issues because both were not exposed to each other during school.
On the other hand, I support the idea of separating them in terms teaching sometimes, it's easier to teach girls than boys. They can concentrate and pay more attention than boys.
I also think that it's not healthy to separate them with all the technology that we live in today. I mean the gap is becoming minimized.
