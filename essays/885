A study in 2010 shows that only 18% of computer science degrees in US are women down from 37% in 1985, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. This indicates that we have a serious problem, that there is a lack of women entering the tech industry and we have to know the factors that lead to this problem and solve them.
I think that there are several reasons that lead to this first. It starts in schools. Boys sometimes have stereotypes that girls don't fit to study physics and when girls decide to study it in school teachers don't encourage them to continue and they even don't try to change this stereotype.
Second, media stereotypes have another role in discouraging females to pursue science for example the two movies "Revenge of the Nerds" and "The Big Bang Theory", says Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, represent the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian make geeks, and it might be the reason of the decline in a number of women worker in a teach field.
Third, parents always advice girls to choose the simples subject to study in order to have more time for his family in the future after marriage. And being emotional many girls prefer simple careers to have more time with their children and this shows a gender problem which emphasize that women is the one who carries the responsibility of their homes and families.
Finally, I think that we have a serious problem that women don't pursues careers in tech fields, therefore we need, as society to take a responsibility to change this stereotype that there are careers that fit men only and special careers that fit women. It start from home and continue at school to prepare new generations to accept their tendency of any subject they want to study without the gender obstacle.
