Pokémon Go is a game that the user needs to hurl Poke balls by the help of GPS.
Most of the users are adults and teenagers, which they are influenced by this game strongly. They spend their time looking for Poke balls at public places without caring to things around them.
I did not download this game and I do not want to download it either because of the bad things that I heard about. Moreover, I had a bad experience with this game.
My cousin used to play it while driving, which lead us to do a car accident only because she was looking for Poke balls in the era without being aware for the traffic. This is a strong evidence that shows that I am against this game.
This game has a bad influence for the users. Especially for the teenagers.
Many of the users believe that, looking for Poke balls lead them to explore new places in the era around them. However, they do not know that it could lead them to many risks. For example, when the user uses this game he spends most of his time outside looking for Poke balls, the user does not aware the street and to things around him, he looks and cares only for his phone therefore, he might fall or being crashed by car without noticing.
The teenagers should go out and to have fun and to explore places by themselves not by a game. This game will not last for a long time in order to encourage the users to explore new places. Therefore, parents should encourage their children to go out and to explore the era around them by themselves.
To sum up, Pokémon Go is a bad influence for the users, I never used to play it and will not play it because I am against this game because of the risks that I above. And I really hope that no one get hurt because of it.
