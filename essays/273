Humans in general are not used to the heat in the summer, so they tend to use the air conditioner in order to feel cold, at offices, stores, at homes also everyone uses the air conditioner, but the usage of it it's different from one to another.
Some might overuse air conditioning, some might have the average usage for the conditioning, for example, stores, cars, offices, people at these places use air conditioner much, and it might be over the need but this some consider it as a sign for power and prestige.
According to Murphy (2015), that being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures from mass-market stores.
In the other hand, some claims that they can't work or do their daily jobs with lower temperature, Hedge and Gaygen (2010) state that, the optimum work temperature is +23-24 C and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature lower than that.
To conclude, it depends on human's norms how they like to be conditioning, because it differ from one to another.
