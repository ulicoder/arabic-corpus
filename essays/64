Based on my personal experience, students shouldn't be allowed to evaluate their teachers for several reasons. The first one is that the students are not aware enough to the meaning of the term evaluation. As a result of that they can evaluate the teacher according to one case they had experienced with him. For example, I can't forget the moment when the principal decided to let the pupils evaluate teachers in my school. The pupils mislead this tool to evaluate teachers in a very bad way. Their evaluations were based on their marks only and it wasn't done correctly. The second reason is that student are influenced by each others. They had a negative impact on each other so their evaluation may be done according to the others opinion. The pupils want to be a part of the whole and don't want to be outside the group, so they decide to evaluate as the others do.
