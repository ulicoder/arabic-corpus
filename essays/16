Researchers agree that a late start for schools is more beneficial for students minds. Still, I do not totally agree for several reasons: first, some students will not take responsibility of this process and go to bed early and get enough rest and sleep so they will wake up active in the morning. Second, some of them will stay late at night, since they don't have to wake up early next morning. So, they will come to school tired and not being able to concentrate in classes. Besides, I believe that late start leads to late end. I do not totally agree with this idea, it has to be explained and talked about a lot among parents, students and teachers.
