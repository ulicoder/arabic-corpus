Phones were originally made as a phonetic communicating tool. People back then used phones to call and communicate via sounds (speech). However, today, it is shown that young people are using their smartphones for other purposes than calling. The )2 company showed that the "telephone" apps are only the fifth-most-used app among the general public. Thus, Millennials prefer texting to calling. This phenomenon stems from the fact that when you call someone you are more likely to get an immediate reply. Therefore, texting give the option of not replying immediately and thinking about the answer. Another explanation might be that when texting, people don't have small talk and usually get a straight answer.
Personally, I do use texting apps more than the "telephone" app for several reasons. First is the fact that I don't know what the other person is doing. If he or she is busy or if I will interrupt something important. Therefore, I prefer texting them and getting a reply when possible.
Secondly, the texting apps give me the option of not replying immediately and I find this really good.
However, using the texting apps has its own disadvantages. Looking at the matter from the viewpoint of human communication, texting apps actually decrease the human communication that includes seeing the other participant or hearing them. Texting apps increase the technological communication that is somehow turning them into robots.
