My presentation was about a story it's called "The Tell-Tale Heart" by the writer Edgar Allan Poe.
I did my presentation with Ekram Taha, we chose this story to present because we like it when we read, it is full of mysterious.
We felt that the story was interesting to present about which made us so excited to do our presentation in front of the class.
I think it was a very good presentation, I was confident and well prepared and I think my partner was like me also, we worked hard in order to success and present very good.
However there were some grammar mistakes.
I liked that the students were focusing with us and they participated also.
The activity was good; however I felt that we had to do it in more interesting way.
