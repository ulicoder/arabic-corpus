Cynthia Ozick's novel "The Shawl" is one of the most interesting novels I had read. It describes the most significant period in the world in a time when Nazis protested against Jews community, and decided to destroy them using the hardiest circumstances in concentration camps that were built during World War 2 by unjust leader, Adolf Hitler. After the first reading of the novel "The Shawl", I was exposed to an important historical details and events that become turning points of the world revolution. It is a fascinating experience to run a complete research in order to discover new main ideas, event, actions and reasons hidden between the lines. Also, to find out issues that were revealed to the readers through the characters, such as, thoughts of the Jews community, feelings and critical decisions that were taken at the most critical moments in order to survive and avoid death.
This experience affected me positively. In addition, it changed my direction of thinking and improved my view of analysis. Today, after being tough to follow a couple of steps in analyzing fiction and to pay attention to significant issues that we never noticed before, in my opinion, this experience was a clever step to test ourselves after a whole year of practicing.
I think my presentation organized well because of the hard work and learning analysis; the main points of the novel presented explicitly and then explained clearly. Although, there were some difficulties with eliciting specific information, to analyze them and to relate them to the novel "The Shawl" since it deals with the description from the character's point of view. However, I was satisfied with the way I introduced the whole topic.
