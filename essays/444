Reading what are these three articles dealing with is not surprising me as one of the users, however, I cannot avoid the fact that these articles are pointing to important issues. "Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job"; this article deals and indicates very popular issue that become a regular trend in social media world, people who spend a lot of hours on Instagram actually can benefit of this time! Think of gaining money in time where others spend their day in difficult, boring and irregular jobs.
Today, people become aware of what attracts others on Instagram, they can give advice, post about healthy food, shopping, beauty and for this they gain money... So, life could be easy. In other hand, we also need to look to the dark side of these things, in my opinion, people sometimes become less interested in social communication and they easily lose any contact with other as a result of their new habit.
We can conclude that everything has two sides that we can't avoid any of them; good and bad side.
