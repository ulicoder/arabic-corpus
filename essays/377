I would prefer to talk about the article "Posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" due to the experience I had which is close to the main topic of the article. In addition to the easy and fast way to communicate with people around us from different contries and cultures by Instagram, is is useful and helps to improve the financial situation for each user of Instagram. Few months ago I used to work as sales promoter by presenting some items for local brands on my page, against this I recieved a few dollars as a payment for the customers that increased to the brand by me.
This article shows one of thousands of deeds of Instagram also it urges and convinced people to create account and have an Instagram page not only to follow show and comment also to have a job and earn money.
