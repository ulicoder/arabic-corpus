First of all, before starting working on the presentation I thought that it will be very hard and I will not overcome it easily because I have never analyzed a story or any novel, but there was a positive side which says "I can do it".
I started analyzing and discovering the story with my partner and we found interesting things are hidden between the lines which made me feel excited to go over all the story sides and discover them.
While working on the presentation and preparing it we faced a small problem in laptops and access to our emails, however at the end we success presenting something, but not all that we discovered, we (me and my partner) felt very sorry to be in this position but then we continued and finished the presentation (PowerPoint). Also, we learned that we shouldn't wait till the last moment, it actually wasnâ€™t the last moment but we understand that we must finish the work before the date in a couple more days
I think that "The Necklace", is a very good story to discover and analyze because it shows a very interesting situation and its events make the reader excited and shocked more and more. The events were very exciting for me as a reader and become more exciting when I started analyzing and reading between the lines, true it's not a poem and it's not hard to understand but it has very good meanings.
At the end, I want to mention that it was a very good and exciting experiment, I enjoyed it, also I learned a lot from it, and of course, analyzing the story/novel/poem will be easier in the next time.
