As a teacher and mother, I believe that homework is important for kids but not long tasks. Kids spend at least six hours a day at school, so if they are given a lot of homework every day it will make them feel depressed. On the other hand, I believe that kids must live their childhood so the school has to make an agreement among all the teachers, is not to give pupils homework every day, and when they give them it has to be short.
For conclusion, kids must live their childhood, so short homework has to be given for pupils for practice.
