Yes, sure I agree that the younger people more enjoy than the older people because in my opinion the younger people have more technology like iPhone laptop blackberry or whatever make them more enjoy and make his life very interesting while the oldest people I think they don’t have the same tool to make his life full energy. This from one hand, from the other hand the older people maybe they don’t have a many problem and Hassles like the younger, because in past period they live a quiet life without difficult but the technology not the reason for this hassles. On the contrary if they was have a cars for example so they can have a more comfortable life also the social media one of joyful thing that enable them to make connection with others’ lives on difference country or in faraway distance, as well the development in everything like education the percentage of education increase at the last period who lead them to live life more enjoy. At the last I’m as a younger girl feeling my life so successful and joyful than the older people, but I believe also its something dependence for each person like if the person was younger or older have positive outlook for life they can feel themselves in happiness mood but if they don’t have this outlook and they think in negative so they can’t enjoy in life, at the last we all should have this positive perspective to lives in happens and safety life.
