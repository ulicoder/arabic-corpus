There are fewer girls and women in scientific subjects at schools and universities. These subjects are dominated mainly by males students. This negatively impact the labor sector, in which less females participated in science and technology fields. In this essay I will examine the reasons that lead women to be absent from science subjects and fields.
According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in US. This might be because of gender inequality at schools from an early age. Even before school, parens encourage girls to play with dolls, while they encourage their boys to play with lego or puzzles. The former are encouraged to nurture others, while the latter are encouraged to think and solve problems. This continue at school too. Teachers usually think that girls are better at languages, whereas boys are better at math and science. Therefore, teachers direct girls and boys according to this gender disparity. Another main reason for the lack of women in science fields is illustrated in the absence of scientists females figures in movies and series.
