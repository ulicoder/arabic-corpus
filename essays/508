Enjoying life is a general term that each person in the world can identify it differently than other, some people find the life enjoyment in studying, yet, others find it in building a family, some even might say that traveling is the joy of life. But in general it is known that young people enjoy life more than older ones, cause of their young and full energy to accomplish more than elderly people do, but is that enough to identify the young people as the most joyful variety? My opinion is quite the opposite I think that old people do get the chance to enjoy life more than the young ones of a couple of reasons.
Every 20s person these days is stuck either in college or work or dealing with kids if the person is married, so eventually there is no time no enjoy life. Me personally, at this period, I do not consider myself enjoying life, since I am stuck in college and I will finish three years from now, after that I'm going to work with my certification, and enjoying live in my perspective happens when I'm sitting home cooking with my grandchildren around me.
Let us also not forget that the young people in general do not have enough money to actually get the chance to travel and try new things so that they could enjoy life. Yet older people specially in Israel get paid monthly without them working. Pension. Elderly people have time and money in hand, that is why they get the chance to experience more and to enjoy life at its fullest.
Generally speaking, in my own personal perspective I believe that elderly people are the ones that really enjoying live, and I am going to work now so that hopefully when I grow older I will find both money and time so that I could get the chance to wrap my whole life up in a happy experience.
