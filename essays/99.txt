The word that I do not really want to use it in front of my students is number six. In English, there are many words that have the same sounds but have different writing. When the date be 6th/16/26, actually, I pronounce them in Arabic. Since all the students there are teenagers and when I pronounce this number they start laughing and annoying some girls.
Unfortunately, the students consider this number as a sexual thing. That's why I don't like to use it.
