Our presentation was about “A very old man with enormous wings” which I really liked. Jawana and I worked very hard on it and tried to understand it well at the beginning. Jawana was very good presenter and she makes a good partner to work with, we helped each other during the presentation because we both were stressed.
I was very stressed before we begin our presentation, but when we started, all the stress faded, I was confident, and I thought that I am here to learn and to make mistakes. During the presentation I really liked how I asked questions to students and they answered and participate, it gave me a good feeling that they talked and expressed their thoughts about the story which shows that they are following. I think the activity that Jawana and I did was very good, it allowed students to be creative and to see also what their classmates drew also. After the students finished and 3 students share their drawings, I really wished if more students participate and share with the whole class what they think of the drawings, in future I will ask more students to share with us, but all in all I saw enjoyment in the activity. The question that I asked that what would you do if you were one of the crowd is a good question, it is worth asking like this type of question because it gives students to think deeply and think if they were in the position of this character what would they do, so I will ask more questions in future and be more creative when I prepare an activity, maybe act a scene or create an avatar on their cellphones.
