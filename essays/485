Seeing an old couple on the metro, every morning, holding hands and picking each other's cheeks, looking into each other's eyes and smiling, like the whole world's happiness is in the palms of the hand they hold makes one stop and think, did I find happiness? Are those short moments, when I felt my heart is attempting to fly, what real happiness is?
Living youth in a world where each individual is somehow fighting to exist, fit in and be accepted makes it less accurate to state and declare that young people are able to enjoy life more than older people, it is even less convincing when one looks at how youths are struggling to find their place in the society, something elders have already been through, and had already achieved.
Being young can be pleasurable, but just as well being old too. It is all goes back to how each and everyone sees life, through which window and according to which standards. Being optimistic and positive about life can make live more enjoyable, regardless of age. Being happy comes back to one's self and his approach towards living, with all the ups and downs.
Life is a rollercoaster which everyone rides, there is no age limit. Throughout the ride there will always be hard times, moments where a person may wish to get off and leave, or to be allowed to take a break, some would laugh, others would cry, but in the end each person will feel differently about the experience, again, regardless of their age.
Happiness and enjoying life resonate from each person's heart and mind, it glimmers and shine, or dim out and fade. And as Franz Kafka, the Hungarian Author, says "Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty. Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.‚Äù
