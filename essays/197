The school is an institution that students attend not only to acquire knowledge but also to develop the students' social skills. However, schools like all-girls schools could limit those skills because of the lack of exposure to the other gender. Therefore, in this paper I intend to discuss the negative aspects of attending all-girls schools.
Girls could establish false assumptions surrounding boys. As a result fo the lack of communication specially face to face communication, girls might develop the idea that all boys are bad influence or they should stay away from, them for their best interest. Moreover, girls could come to the conclusion that boys are careless just because they are separated from them.
Some females are more comfortable in having male friends that female friends. In school, having a friend is a very crucial things for students specially those in their teen years and some females don't feel comfortable while talking to other girls instead they enjoy having males friends.
Students could be more competitive when they face another gender. Boys vs. girls is a battle never ending, and competing could push the students to be the best between not only the girls but also the boys. Therefore students become more passionate toward their grades so they will not fall behind both groups.
In conclusion, even though education is important, it is not the only purpose of attending school. Moreover, students need to live the full experience to be more ready to their life as adult and there is no such thing as only girls life. Therefore, parents should take a step back and allow the students to enjoy their experience in school.
