In many schools tablets have taken over textbooks in spite of the fact that many people worldwide talk about the negative impact of technology on children. More advanced nations are equipping children at schools with tablets in place of textbook. Can this provide better learning for these children? I believe that it can if we keep our eyes open to the disadvantages that may come along.
Buying textbooks for children have become a financial burden on most parents. Using tablets instead can be more affordable and it is far more enjoyable and engaging to the pupils. According to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), pupils who used tables have improved their math results by 20% in one year compared to pupils who used regular text book. In addition using tablets is more ecologically friendly and we don't have to cut down many trees for additional text books. Also using tablets pupils and teachers can stay connected. On the other hand using tablets can have many disadvantages on pupils. When pupils have tablets they can be easily distracted. Pupils who are still young can become addictive to the device. There are many harmful contents on the internet and these children can get harmed. A study by Singer and Alexander (2016), found that tablets can be more enjoyable but the learning process with text books is better.
To conclude, I think that using tablets is inevitable. We cannot escape technology nowadays. We have to pay attention to the fact that it is best to use technology while being careful. Tablets can be enjoyable and a great tool for our pupils if we keep directing and guiding them.
