To enjoy life, you don't have to be responsible for anything, and that makes it easier for young people to enjoy their life.
Enjoying life have a lot of meanings, it is different from a person to another. Some people see it as traveling abroad and some people think that it's hanging out with friends, playing any kind of sports or staying out late at night or being with the family.
But young people have more abilities to enjoy life than older people. When you get older, your responsibilities become more and more harder too. Young people can do whatever they want because they have a limited responsibility unlike older people, older people have more things to do like work or making money or taking care of their families.
Moving to the matter of time, young people have more free time, all they have is one or two simple tasks in their daily life like school or studying, but older people have many harder tasks like going to work, taking care of their family,
Another thing is that young people have more energetic than older people have, because most of older people have health problems and most of older people.
