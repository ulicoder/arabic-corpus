In my opinion, single gender schools are not good ideas. Fundamentally, I believe that when boys and girls learn together, first, they attempt to prove themselves and they will work hard to achieve high marks. Second, when boys and girls learn together they will share thoughts and ideas. Third, competing is a solid example of what is natural to happen inside the class room. Boys and girls have different personalities and characteristics, so they will compete. In my opinion that competing is fine. It is a solid method to learn and to gain information. It is a positive competing. When girls feel they are intimidated by boys they should complain and tell their educator. They should be strong enough to stop the negative competing.
Girls are good and have strong personalities and they can improve their learning not solely because boys attempt to prove themselves but because they can study and succeed.
Finally, learning together helps to improve social relationships and help both sides not to be conservative and they will be open minded. Males and females should study together and build a solid society and a fine community.
