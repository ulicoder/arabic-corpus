I agree with this evaluation, but it should be objective and serve certain points. Here we don' talk about person, but about methods and materials that the teachers taught. I, strongly, believe in improving and developing our ways of teaching by being evaluated by those same students who listen and learn from us as teachers. On other hand, the system has to find effective way to make students evaluate teachers in a neutral and useful way.
