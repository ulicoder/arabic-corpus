Textbooks and tablets are part of more schools lately, the use of tablets is increasing, where it is claimed that it enhances students' levels in various subjects. For instance, Harcourt (2011), "showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional textbook".
Opposingly, some people might assume that this increasing use of technology, in this case tablets in school leads to a failure in the learning process, as they would rather stick to the use of textbooks. Singer and Alexander (2016), support this opinion as they found that [even though] "school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbooks". Ultimately, the use of technology in schools should have a limit at a certain point, textbooks will always be used as a reference therefore, no matter how influential technology gets in schools it will not outweigh the print textbooks.
