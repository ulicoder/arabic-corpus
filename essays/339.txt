Learning is a lifestyle, and an essential part of the process of learning is receiving an evaluation, as teachers evaluate their students, giving them feedback on their process, it is only fair that the students evaluate their teachers, expressing their opinion and attitude towards the materials and the methods the teacher uses in class.
I believe learning is part of growing up, becoming better, and for me to become a better teacher I would like to receive evaluation on my teaching from my students, so that I am able to work on developing my methods and sharpening my skills.
After years of being in the field, an evaluation of the teacher become more of an important step, as the teacher may stir away from the methods and principles she had set for herself, at the beginning of her career, therefore, an evaluation from her students would work as a reminder for the teacher, to get back on track and improve her teaching.
In conclusion, teachers' evaluation is essential for guaranteeing that the teachers are delivering their message as they should, and that the student are receiving the proper learning.
