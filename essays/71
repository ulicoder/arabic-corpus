In my opinion, driver's license at the age of 16 is not mature enough to drive because they are so young and they are more likely to take a risks, become distracted and make mistakes.
Should be tested for driving ability and knowledge of road rules before being issued with a license and after age 16. The learner drivers should be permitted on the road at an earlier age under supervision.
