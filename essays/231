A lot of people prefer the easy work, rather than the physical work. But it varies when we talk about a woman choosing her career and a man selecting his suitable job.
In general, as a girl, I prefer not to work in computer and tech fields, because I think that it is not a job that fits a girl. This does not indicate that computer fields are forbidden for girl. However, it would be special thing for a woman to work in this field.
