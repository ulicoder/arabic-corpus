The city center is the most important place in the city, where there are many important institutions that the population needs. This makes it full of cars. Many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center. I am explicitly agree with this act.
First, the presence of a large number of cars in the city center obstructs traffic, which will negatively affect the population where their time will be lost inside the traffic jam.
Secondly, preventing cars from entering the city center reduces road accidents. The huge number of people moving around the city center and the phenomenon of sidewalks being used by vendors to deliver their goods is no longer a place for people to walk. Thus endangering their lives.
