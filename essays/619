At first, I and my classmate Noor Khamaisy decided to work together on our oral presentation because we are close to each other personally what makes it is easy to cooperate and contact. After that we went over the stories list and had a look on the stories and the author of each one. Finally, we decided to work on "The Hunger Artist" story by Franz Kafka because we love his writing way and style.
We started searching on the author life and resume and if there is anything interesting in his biography after that we read the story alone and each one highlighted the phrases and sentences that looked important and interesting then we compared and discussed it with each other and went over the presentation requirements to make sure we cover all the sides. Then we organized it in one presentation and to prepared our self to present.
We did not pay attention to the activity and we did not know it is mandatory till the last day so it was so difficult to create an interesting and creative activity we decided to have something like that: to divide the class into 2 groups at the end of the presentation and to ask each group what do they understand and something they remember about the story and to write them on papers and the group that write the more right information is the winner.
I think there are 2 sides should have developed in our presentation. First: the presentation itself as visual aid. We should decorated it more and put more interesting photos to attract the class and second: the activity we should have thought about something more creative and interesting especially because our story was about a very interesting topic (consideration hunger as an art).
In the end, I can say our presentation was not excellent but at least was not bad and that experience taught me how to work in pairs and to cooperate with someones else and how to analyze a story and of course gave expanded my brain for more ideas in my next presentations.
