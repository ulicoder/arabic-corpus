I teach elementary graders. There are two words that I don't like to teach. My pupils start to show me "sneaky" smiles when they hear the words "six" and "always". They look at each other and laugh too. The word "six" sounds for them as the word "sex". The other word "always" reminds them with all the commercials about menstrual pads for Always company. Boys laugh and smile while the girls faces look so red. They become very shy and embarrassed.
