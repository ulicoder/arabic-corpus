My presentation was about the short story "The Muse", by Hector Hugh Munro (Saki). I presented it with my partner Ronza. The presentation was divided into two parts: the first presenting the story using powerpoint, and the second doing an activity in order to check students' understanding of the story.
I am going to talk about my feeling while preparing the story and while presenting it, in addition, I am going to talk about how Ronza and I prepared and worked on the story. Ronza and I prepared the story together, first we read it together and then we started analyzing it and writing the important points, it was hard to do this without any help from the teacher, especially that this was the first time to present a story. Ronza and I did some research in order to find enough information that will help the students understand the story, and we were responsible for discussing the following that the teacher gave us.
While we were preparing the story, I felt comfortable and I was excited, and working in pair helps me to be comfortable because it was enjoyable, it decreases the stress, and it helped me a lot and made it easy for me to prepare and analyze a story
On the day of presenting the story, I felt nervous but when I started talking and presenting my feeling of anxiety went away, I felt confident.
At the end, I want to improve one thing which is to write less on the slides and to talk more, and I believe that I can do this, and that I can improve myself.
