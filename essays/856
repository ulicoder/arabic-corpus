The long stretch summer vacation is for both teachers and students. They need to rest. Teachers need to rest their voice and body in addition students need to rest their bodies and minds from studying and tests, together with that to enjoy. However, the only side who disagrees with the long stretch of summer vacation is the parents. Their argument against the long vacation may influence its length. In my opinion the parents' argument could be accepted by the Ministry of Education because parents claim that children do not have appropriate frames to stay at in the vacation.
Moving on to teachers' side, despite all of the parents claims, teachers need that long stretch vacation, in order to rest and travel. In addition to clear their mind and to gain energy for the year after. Furthermore teachers are not allowed to take short vacations during the school year, so they can not travel in that period. In my opinion they need long time of traveling to feel satisfied and enjoy life.
On the other hand, the students need a long time to relieve the tension and to relax after the studying and the tests period in addition to gain energy.
In my opinion the advantages of the long stretch of the summer vacation outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore the long vacation is a great period for both teachers and students to rest and shortening it is not a good idea.
