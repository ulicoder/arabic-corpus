Staying home is the favorite part of my daily life, winter allows me to practice my hobby with is spending as much as possible time with my lovely family. Cold makes me feel the warmth of my home which I miss a lot. Summer season includes so many activities that keeps me away of my home as a result of that I really prefer winter.
