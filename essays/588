Yes I agree that the connect between the student and the teacher more important than the excellent knowledge because in my opinion no matter how much the material has a difficult if there are a strong teacher with a encourage I think that’s its make the student more activity and has a super power to access the subject with a good grade because if the student has a good relationship between her\his teacher he\she pass 50% present of his afraid and make his sense and his energy more ability to build a huge of motivation to access all the difficult .
We cant forget mention that the excellent knowledge of the subject also has a lot important because if the student know what he or she cope and has more knowledge about the material than others then he has ability to success but on the other hand if the student has a lot of knowledge and don’t have a good connected with the teacher absolutely he\she didn’t feel comfortable and she\he didn’t get the same grade.
At the last we all have a many of opinions but I very agreed that if the teacher is lovely and patent and has a lot of a good advantages its will get the top ability of the students.
