Some people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do, but in my opinion it is the opposite; that young people are enjoying their lives more than older people and that's because older people do not have the energy and the passion as young people have.
Young people living their lives without looking at the past, they live day by day,because they may think that life is once, and they should do everything without regret, also do things spontaneously without a plan which makes everything more enjoyable. In addition, young people have the power and the desire to experience everything that is potential for them, for example, travel the world in order to explore it alone is such an amazing experience for young people to do in a young age, and that's experience may not be just for fun, but rather for self-discovering and living independently. However, older people may have this opportunity but they have more reasonability and properties that make their time limited to enjoy their life such as: they have to think about their children first, and for earning money to live.
In addition, technology is a good reason for youngers to enjoy their life, because every day they came up with new invention and new device that may interested them. Also, the variety of social media applications such as: Facebook, Instagram, twitter which helps them to be always in contact with their friends outside and inside their country they live in. nevertheless, older people may have an interest in technology but they will find it really complicated and they cannot deal with it as younger people, so they will get bored from it by the time.
To sum up, the life of younger people is different than the life of older people in many ways that I have mentioned. Surely I am not saying that older people cannot enjoying their life but there's many things that can in some point stops them.
