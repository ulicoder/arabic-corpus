I believe that students should evaluate their teachers because they are one of the basic elements (or components) in the teaching process. Therefore when moving (or finishing) each year, the educational institution whether it's a school, college, or a university, they should ask their students for their evaluation toward their teachers.
Although that one may think that students aren't a reliable source to ask for evaluation because of multiple reasons. One of them that students can tell that a certain teacher isn't qualified to teach because they got a low grade with her. Another situation might be that students won't tell that a certain teacher is bad because he's not teaching them but rather s/he lets them waste time and not learning. This situation can happen sometimes.
However, although some students might not tell the truth, it can be a chance for other students to express their thoughts especially if it's done anonymously. Each one can write what bothers, hurts, pleases or bores her. In addition, I think it's an intrapersonal feedback that the teacher would like to read with herself because s/he can takes specific things into consideration and deal with them, like if thinks that s/he has done and bad effects on the students, s/he talk to them personally or starts working on herself to improve bad sides that she has. In the end, it can be seen that both sides can get the advantage of their teachers.
