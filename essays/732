I want to describe a nice thing I did for my best friend, she is always afraid from the exam, especially from math. First, I said to her that the exam just in order to know our potentials and math need extra information. Must focus with the teacher this very important, the secret success.
In addition, I tried to give her influential words, and support her, after this she is relax and I told her don't do what I did, also I'm was afraid from the exams but now I love exams especially math, we want study together for the exam. After week was there is exam. She came to me and solve some questions in math with her. In the next day after the exam, she said that the exam very simple and good, was very happy and comfortable. To sum up, Im happy because can helped someone.
