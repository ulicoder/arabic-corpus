I would choose the theme - Phonology- because this theme attracts me to think more about it and this leads me to read more about the phonology and try to discover new information, new knowledge and to be more knowledgable.
So if we come to the definition of this theme -> phonology It's mean:
Minimal pairs are two similar sounding words that differ in only one phonological element and have distinct meanings.
For example:
phonemes pronunciation morphemes spelling
1) Cat+s Kats Cats
2) Rose+s Roziz Roses
Minimal pair of examples:
*Shoes -> Choose.
*Cat-> Can.
The minimal pairs differ from another language can be very hard for a language learner.
Example: palatalization in Russian (krov - krov" )
A phoneme can be pronounced in different ways depending on the context
For example:
~ Top
T(h)op
~ Stop
Stap
I think the phonology have so many pieces of information.
If we take a look from above we will see that the phonology is from the basics of the English language and this the most thing I love about the phonology.
The second step I like to mention
The spelling of the words that makes me being so interested in how we could spell the words in a way or adding new characters
without write it!
So I go to the library and I started searching about this topic and begin to found out many words that we are spelling in a way and write it in another way.
And the funniest thing that happened to me, when I started to spell these words to see the difference between the words and this makes me feel better when my mode was off.
And we shouldn't forget that the phonology is apart from our lives, the phonology is the basis of our talking with the people, when we want to communicate with them we use our words our spelling helping with our ill mouth...
Endly, the phonology is the theory that has a very big interest in me and I like it so much.
