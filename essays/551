I think that the teacher should be in good relationship with his students, he should respect them, treat them very well and understand where is the weakness point for each student and focus on it in order to help them, make them better students and give them more self-confidence.
There is a huge effect on students by how is the teacher react with them during the class, if the teacher was cruel or disrespectable with his students m they will ignore and hate to listen or focus with this teacher, otherwise they will not understand the materials.
But if the teacher was calm, patient, good, respectable with his students and take care of them and understand there weakness points in the materials.
The students will treat him very good also they will have good marks and be excited more to his class.
The way that the teachers give the students the materials is very important because the teacher is like a model to the students so the more he was good with them the more they will be good and active in positive way during classes.
The teacher should be optimistic person to spread his positive energy to the students so he is the reason to make the students more successful.
Teachings them a variety of ways, to make the students more interested at the topic and give them more explanations to make it easy on them to understand.
