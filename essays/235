Nowadays, women and girls aren't pursuing careers in computing and tech fields. Some researchers assume that the causes of this matter are parents, teachers and society in general. As widely known, parents are one of the central factors that affects their children college / university's study, the subject and the field that they choose to pursue. On the other hand there are some researchers who assume that the cause of that is the rise of pop culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movie and TV.
Girls and women receive less courage from parents and society on the wider subjects like science and technology, and this issue is becoming less popular these days. But it will never end. Many girls fail on their studies and the fields that their parents force them to go through and pursue, despite the fact that they don't want to study. Then, therefore, they're going through problems and failers. Parents have a huge effect on their sons and daughters success, and if girls do not receive the same courage that the boys get they obviously will fail.
Parents in our society do not support their girls to study science and technology for mysterious reasons, that have no explanations and expectations. They don't receive courage and support to pursue those kind of subjects, thus less girls and women study them, so if they receive more courage to study those subject they will study and succeed more than boys / men.
In conclusion, parents and society should encourage girls and women to pursue the technology and science fields more and to try new subjects, because they are equal the same as men and deserve to study what they want to.
