In my opinion, the reason why girls are not pursuing careers in computing fields is that society supposes that these careers are only for boys, since early childhood boys get games which are related to technology and computing, while girls get dolls and so on.
Another factor that affects that is that girls tend to think that they cannot handle these types of jobs, so they prefer to stay at home and to choose other careers.
