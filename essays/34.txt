In my opinion, students should start their day at school at 10:00 am instead of 8 am. First, kids need to sleep more in order to be more alert and active during the day. Second, according to researchers brain starts properly working at 10:30 am. That means if students start earlier, it is unhealthy for their brain.
In addition, some students are more alert later than in the morning. Moreover, starting school later gave students more time to have a good healthy breakfast.
