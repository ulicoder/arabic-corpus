I would like to describe a nice thing I did when I was 15 years old, Let's bring back memories. Everyday I wake up, And went to the school with my classmate. In the streat we saw a semi-detached house fired! We wasn't know what to do But, when I see a baby wave and setting behinde the window, we decided to break the house door with the aid of the neighbors And, Help the baby. Actually, this story is imagination but it's close to the reality, Right?
