There has been an ongoing debate of whether paper books are better than ebooks or not. Even though, both type of books have their own advantages and disadvantages, some people prefer the usage of one type and argue that it is better than the other type.
A PWC Consulting survey in 2019 found that in 2018, e-book sales were higher than print books sales in US and UK. The main reason for this finding may be the availability of the content. As purchasing an e-book only takes a few minutes and it could never be sold out. In addition, e-books can be read anywhere on any electronic device such as cellphone, computer or iPad. It is more convenient than carrying a paper book around.
On the other hand, there are some people who are loyal to paper books and prefer using them for various reasons.
A study by Helm, Ligon, Stovall, and Van Riper (2018) found that participating US college students preferred paper books over e-books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provide. Certainly, e-books do not provide this kind of experience. However, they also provide a satisfying reading experience.
In conclusion, paper books and e-books may provide different reading experience. However, each experience has its own charm. Thus, we cannot decide for sure which type of books is better, because it is all related to each person preference and the type of reading experience they seek. Personally, I prefer the convenience that e-books bring, but if I find a good paper book I would still read it and enjoy the experience.
