Some people believe that homework is important for students while others believe that students should rest and play after spending all day studying.
Homework is an extremely important factor in a student. Some people consider that homework is more important than exams. When a student learns something new it is important to practice it at home so it would be in his long-term memory rather than just learning it once and forgetting about it.
Another important fact why homework is important is that it helps students be prepared for exams.
Furthermore, when it is time for the exam students are already ready for it, all they need to do is to review what they learned.
When leaving school, usually student go straight to watching TV or playing video games and sometimes parents are busy with either housework or with their job. So they do not pay much attention how long their children are using technology.
Having homework makes parent and children more organized. Parents will consider time for their children's homework.
Therefore, homework is really important in our life, it help us memorize and be more organized.
