The teacher must have so much appellate because she is one that student look at and they see themselves on her but for me the most important thing for the teacher and for the student is to be patient because they will consider to be kind caring wisdom and inspirational.
The teacher is the key to have I succeed students, I believe that the teacher is the one that will make the student decided to love this subject or not to become a teacher you should be patient.
Patient how to deal with the student.
Patient because sometime you will have bad day but you should be patient and try to control yourself so that will not effect on the student.
Patient because sometime you will listen to lies and harmful thing from student but you should understand them in addition there time will came that you will explain the thing so many time sometime not because they do not understand what you say but because they was playing around or not listing to you but the teacher should be patient in fact all of us was like that so careless.
At last that the subject that you love and care about and the most important thing that the subject that you love to teach so if you want to became a good teacher you must have patient.
And you should smile always even when you feeling sad.
Patient is not a simple word when a student came to you because they are depressed our have a difficult time you should be patient and calmed down to know how to deal with him.
On other word patient meaning have faith on other and in yourself and believe that there nothing you can not deal with or feeling helpless as long as you patient so you can thinking straight.
