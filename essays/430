To begin with, I would like to point out that I have not heard of this concept before, or in other words, when my lecture asked to write a blog on the subject. At first, I thought of a full range of topics and areas such as how important is this concept. And only afterwards, I mean after reading the three articles I found out that I had learned so much new and interesting things about the subject.  Eating clean on "clean eating", means relying less on processed, store-bought items and preparing more meals at home, which could save you money. Furthermore, adopting a clean eating plan can be a simple and effective way to lose weight and boost your overall health. Moreover, it focuses on consuming whole foods that are minimally processed and as close to their natural form as possible. So to get a perfect result for our body, live healthy, and enjoy it, clean eating has become a "trend" all over the world. The three articles I have already read deal with this concept, whereas one of them is the most enjoyable to me which gives 12 way to eat in a clean and healthy way also it was the most advantageous article, however, the two other articles show us how much dangerous is eating when we use it in incorrect means.
To sum up with, in these days, clean eating has become a lifestyle, and not a phenomenon. Each of us really needs to eat clean, in the way we will choose in order to live healthier life.
