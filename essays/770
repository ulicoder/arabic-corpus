Recently the fast food restaurants was popular everywhere even in the schools. Although his negatives, almost all the people eat fast food, even me, but I am agree with the suggestion that fast food restaurants should be banned in the vicinity of schools.
On the one hand the fast food includes materials that do problems in human body, specially the athletes, and students all day eat the fast food.
in the other hand It difficult to find good food that makes in fast, and the students like it, and not expensive. The correct way is the student take his food from the home.
