Now a day, many schools tend to use cellphones as educational tools. It is a common condition in which students can be exposed to different educational programs. However, some students try to use cellphones during the class for other purposes. This problem has become increasingly evident among teens according to many researchers.
For this reasons, in order for students to not be overcome by the use of cellphones during class, rules should be given clearly and strictly.
Many researches indicate that the usage of cellphones during school performance all the time will distract students' attention. This may happen by sending text messages or pictures. Some schools support the idea of using cellphones depending on the fact that it can be helpful and attracts students' attention to understand the material better. However, without limiting the students by following rules, they would have not stop using them for distractive purposes. Therefore, it would be better to use them, for example, for some time only - 5 to 10 minutes.
Other researches indicate that using cellphones during class is not preferable. They think that this can be totally a distraction for the students. In this case, they reject the idea of helping the students to enjoy their learning process. Now a day, integrating technology and modern visual aids are very important in teaching. Most students do not learn in formal teaching they feel boring - which is correct - if teachers do not use many different techniques while teaching, this will end up creating a boring climate. In this case, we can not pin the blame on the students but on the system itself.
In conclusion, when taking all these factors into account, schools should not eliminate the idea of using cellphone in the teaching program, but rather they should find the proper way in which students are able to use cellphones during class with a fully supervision.
