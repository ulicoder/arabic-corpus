I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart" story for my presentation to my classmates at the college due to its fiction detective genre and its humanitarian theme which is the feeling of guilt after committing bad acts. At the beginning, we all hated the narrator's character who committed his crime by killing the old man but at the end we felt a pity for him because he couldn't cope with his feelings of guilt and his alert conscience pushed him to confess his crime to the policemen.
I started my presentation with a very short and straight to the point summary then I and my peer provided the classmates with a short background of the author and then we explained the some of the literary terms and figures of speech in the story such as the characters, themes, plot, narration, simile etc. I felt satisfied because my classmates were all ears to my presentation and were familiar with these terms. I ended my presentation with a sequencing activity in order to make sure that my colleagues understood the story's events well.
I learned from this experience that such literary texts expose us to other cultures, widen our knowledge and provide us with life lessons. In addition, doing tasks in pairs is interesting and more beneficial because we learn a lot from our peers. I also learned that we have to plan everything in advance, divide the workload equally between us and be punctual and on time.
I believe that my presentation was satisfying except the typical sequencing activity that was done at the end of the presentation. I think I should have thought of a more creative activity hoping to do so in the future.
