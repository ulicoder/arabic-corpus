There is so many goals in my mind, first of all I would keep my grades like this and make it better so I can learn any field I want, another one of my dreams that I want to achieve is to be a cardiologist to help people that suffers from many heart disease. Place that I would like to visit is Maldives it is surrounded by water. Last thing in my list that I want that my house be only one floor and beside it a big garden.
