Some students claim that it is much better better for them to start school later in the morning, for example, at 10 instead of 8. This has been proven in research as well. They found that when students start their classes later, they perform better. However, this might not be suitable for all students.
Some students are morning person students and prefer to start school at 8 am. They are more concentrated at the earlier times in the morning.
Other students may have courses or different programs in the afternoon, so they do not prefer to stay late at school and lose the other enjoyable programs after the school.
So, there shouldn't be a law that all schools start times should be adjusted, because it is not suitable for all. Rather, the ministry of education should make both, early and later start times at schools.
Therefore, students can choose whatever is good for them.
