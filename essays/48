There has been a noticeable decline of the percentage of women pursuing careers in computing and tech field. According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, there were just 18% of women who earned a computer science degree in the US in 2010. While in 1985, there were 37% of women who earned this degree. There has been a numerous theories regarding the reason for this decline. The dominant theory is that the low numbers are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys. This theory puts the blame on the parents, teachers and society in general.
Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, supports this theory.
