in my opinion is that the ability to relate well with students is not more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. because if the teacher don't have the good knowledge in his own subject, he can't delever the material to the students and this is a real problem. if the teacher can't connects to the desired result then there is no need for him to be in class , because we call the teacher , " a teacher" not because he is cute and have the ability to relate well with students, we call him that because he knows more than the students who set in class to learn from the excellent knowledge he has. what i mintiond before dos'nt mean that the teacher don't need to have the ability to relate well with students, it is really an importent thing and usually thous are the loved teatchers. but that dosen't mean that they don't need to have the excellent knowledge in the subject they being taught.
