Old-fashioned teaching methods or modern technology use in educational institutions is a very common question in the last years.
Some research show that school students who used tablets instead of traditional textbooks have enjoyed the lessons and showed more interest and pleasure in the learning procedure. In addition, some students final scores have got better when they used iPads instead of books.
Nothwithstanding, research show that students learned better when they used print textbooks. In my opinion, educational institutions should put into consideration the use of both teaching methods: the use of technology as in the use of tablets, iPads or even computers in addition to printed books. A good combination of all tools, if available of course, will get as many types of learners as possible engaged in learning. Furthermore, students will be more interested and engaged in learning because of the variation of tools that would probably attract many students.
I, as a teacher, would prefer using tablets with my students for the practice of theoretical material we've already learned throgh printed textbooks.
