Reading books is intriguing thing to do in life because we need it to understand life and things around us, even at universities, schools, home. Nowadays, there are books that we can read it online and not only on papers.
Some people are bias to read printed books, unlike others who prefer to read it online. Even the people who read e-books more than the people read printed ones, as PWC Consulting found in 2019, that in 2018, e-books sales were higher than print books sales in US and UK. On the other hand some reader prefer printed books because they like the smell of new paper book, according to study that was made by Helm and his colleagues in 2018, participating US college student preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided.
In summary, both reading paper books and e-books are important habit to follow in daily life.
