My dream job is to be a vet; I love pets and wild animals so when I grow up I am planning to have my own clinic.
I have 2 Husky dogs, birds and a special turtle.
Animals are very friendly so it is easy to treat them, all they need is love
It is true that we couldnâ€™t understand them but we can help them.
I wish one day my dream becomes true.
