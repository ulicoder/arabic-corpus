I agree with this statement: "schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers". That is due to several reasons. Firstly, from my personal experience, I had a teacher who was very kind, but he did not know how to pass the material. As a result, students were taken low grades and now one dared to tell the principal about this issue, just because they love him. In this case I preferred if they asked for our evaluation. Secondly, the school should know how their teachers did their jobs, if they use the correct method or not. So it is really important to have students evaluating their teachers. Furthermore, in most of the schools they do this process, in order to develop a more successful way of learning and more professional teacher.
I hope that all school will adapt this way to enhance the awareness of the teachers and the students for their learning process.
