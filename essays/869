Technological devices have been spread rapidly over the past year. Once of these devices is computers, for instance. Teachers, for example, are biased with its uses, and they consider it as an essential tool that lets students communicate with other people from different countries, while parents, in particular, are biased against it uses. I, as a teacher, look at the computer communication from a different standpoint. I believe that letting students communicate with other people and their teachers by emails, for example, is vital for many reasons.
Firstly, in my point of view, communicating by using computers and social media such as facebook, instagram, twitter, will give the opportunity for students to get to know other people's language and traditions.
Secondly, students would have the chance to practice their written English, for example, by writing emails and comments to English native speakers. Thus, they could use the language openly. Finally, as an English teacher, I see that using computer communication is very important, for practicing written English and spoken by listening to English music, for instance. This is done by Youtube.
