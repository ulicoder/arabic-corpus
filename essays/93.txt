Personally, my favorite season is spring; because it marks the end of blistering winter, it helps me feel happier and more content.
In addition, daylight saving time, which moves the clock forward in march, gives us even more light hours to get things done and to enjoy more time with our families in the lovely nature and the stunning views of blooming flowers. My least favorite season is winter, it makes me feel depressed and so emotional, I don't like to go out and prefer to spend my time alone.
