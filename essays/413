The three articles are interesting for me because they are talking about Instagram and almost of us have an account on Instagram. I found that the interesting article was that talks about Instagram and summer job. I like this article because I did not know that when you have a lot of followers you can get money and I think it is interesting for students and teens because they spend most of their time on these accounts. And it is easy because they can study and works in the summer at the same time.
"Posting instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" is the most researched and presenting the best evidence because it's based on people experiences.
