According to research, the number of girls who learn computer science degrees is fewer than that of boys in the same field.
Some theories indicate that boys are more often encouraged to pursue science in higher education or careers. Furthermore, the increasing number of male presence in science fields might be attributed to the smart characters in TV shows who are usually presented as male characters.
From my personal experience, I have noticed that girls, since early ages, are not encouraged to join science fields careers either by their families or society in general.
Most of the girls I know, including me, were raised to be the future moms. We are supposed to think about family and motherhood as a priority before personal benefits. Thus, even though a girl might be very smart and urged to enter computing and tech fields, she is supposed to think about a career that would give her the opportunity both to work and be a good mother.
To sum up, I think that parents have the power to encourage their daughters, if they see that they have the potential, to enter science fields and be supportive enough to make them succeed in their studying or careers.
