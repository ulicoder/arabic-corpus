Ola and I choose to present the short story"The Cask Of Amontillado" by Edgar Allan Poe.
We choose this story because already we familiar with the American writer and we read a certain story that he wrote such as Annabel Lee.
First, we start and to read whole story and then we used the method how to analyze the story such as to analyze characters. Setting and so on, also we used the internet to read about the writer, and to summarize the story, it can help us to understand the story as much as possible. Moreover we saw a videos that related to the story also it can help us to understand better.
Actually, it takes a lot of time to put this information in the slides may I can say this is the difficult part so after that we collect all the information about the author, characters, events we present in front of the students.
Additionally, we apply what we learned when we read a story.
I think that this course helps us a lot when we start to read we enhance and rich our language in our thoughts also.
The most part that I like when I present a presentation the feedbacks it also says that we can always do the better and improve yourself and finally to work on it.
The thing that I would change it is that tell the students to read the story and to come to the class and they have idea what id the story about at least they will pay attention with us while we presenting.
