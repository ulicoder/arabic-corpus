I believe a later start time may lead to a better situation for teachers and students. Getting more and enough sleep is very important. It is hard for students who didn't sleep enough to concentrate well. I notice that many students, especially at the first two lessons, are sleepy and calm without any actions. I'm sure of the system at schools would change and start school at nine or ten o'clock, student will perform better. Even teachers will teach better, because it's hard for them to wake up early and do many issues and be a half past seven at school. Each morning is a marathon.
