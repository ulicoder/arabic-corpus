According to Sarah Jeong, Jeong argues that " Pokémon Go kept me outside and active, and it turned out that searching for the adorable little monsters in augmented reality gave me a new way to enjoy the city around me — I spent days discovering historical landmarks, parks, statues and street art all around the places Pokémon were hiding". Basically, Jeong is saying that Pokemon game it an interesting way for having fun in the city and get closer eye on different places in the city.
According to Kristen Race, Race argues that "Most kids today spend the majority of the school year with their brain already in a state of stress, and staring at a screen while trying to hurl Poké balls at Mewtwo further activates the fight, flight or freeze part of the brain. Even though a child may be playing this game outside, his brain is functioning in the exact same way it would if he were spending hours in an arcade"
In other words, Race believes that the Pokemon Go game destroyed the brain function because it had a negative effect the brain health.
I agree with Race that the Pokemon Go game causes a lot of problems and damaged for the brain because the game freeze part of the brain and the child do not benefit from it while he is playing the game.
