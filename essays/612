In our presentation we present the short story The Necklace by Guy de Maupassant, the power point included the main point to make the students familiar with the story, the title, author background, events, plot structured diagram, literary devices, characters and quote from the story which we tried to analyze, also the presentation included two different activities one to review the main points of the presentation and to check the students understanding, the second the creativity part, we tried – with engaging the students - to retell the story in a different way regarding the analysis to the characters and the events of the story, it was important to us to keep the students concentrate, that for we gave the students a worksheet to answer, in this way they were following. If I get the chance to present it again I would like to expand the themes and the analysis, or perhaps the creativity part I would change it and ask the students to be creative and write the story in a different way, to do it individually and then to share it with the class. I think that we could done better than that, regarding the grammatical and pronunciational mistakes I hope that if we were more careful, because it was slips, but considering that we were the first presenters and we did our best to make it on the eligible level, I don’t regret but I feel that we could done it better.
