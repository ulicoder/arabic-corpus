In my opinion, the summer vacation is long because the pupils do not do anything in two months. They say at home just to pay on the Playstation, to eat three meals all day and to play in the neighbor.
I prefer the school but without learning. I meant to do in the school non-systematic events for the pupils. I think they be better served if the school year were extended through July.
