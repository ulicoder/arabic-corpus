Moving alongside the technological development, more and more aspects in our daily life is turned into technological aspects. One of the things is the book industry. Therefore, books nowadays are turned into e-books which are electronic books and are gaining more popularity (PWC Consulting, 2019).
E-books are considered to be an ecological alternative for the printed books. Looking at the environment today, we see the urgent need to keep the planet clean and green as much as possible. Therefore, ebooks that consume no paper are more suitable than paper books that do harm the environment. Another reason is that e-books can be read on cellphones or tablets that are easy to carry with and weigh less than most paper books. Further, one can have a large number of e-books at the same time on the same device. However, paper books do not easily provide this experience.
However, paper books have advantages as well. Internet access and electronic devices such as laptops and phones that allow us to read via e-books are not accessible or available for everyone. Many people due to various reason might not get the chance to use e-books. Therefore, paper books can still be reasonable and more practical in these situations and cases. Furthermore, e-books do not provide books in the same amount of languages that the paper books provide. Some languages are not that represented as English or other Western languages.
Some researchers claim that "participating US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience" (Helm et al., 2018). However, tactile, olfactory, and emotional values are not considered to be that important reasons compared to environmental reasons. Therefore if the technological developments solves the issues of the accessibility of internet and providing more languages in e-book, I think e-books would be a better replacement.
