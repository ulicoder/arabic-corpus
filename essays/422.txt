A filter bubble is a description of a technical effect used by a number of search engines to determine the search results displayed to users. The technique is that these search engine algorithms guess what information the user might prefer to see based on information about it (such as location, past click behavior, and search history). As a result, the user becomes separate from information that is not consistent with his or her views, Its cultural or intellectual bubbles. Custom search results from Google and the Custom Search Stream from Facebook are key examples of search services based on this technology. so in my opinion this"filter bubble dosent necessary at all althought its give us some advantages but also give us more disadvantages like i'm with it when it dosent show me crimes or wars or any bad things but in the other hand it makes me sad when i dont see my friends massegases etc...
