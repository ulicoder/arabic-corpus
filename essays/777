On every school there should be a comfortable place for eating to the pupils who spend a long time of their day on the school.
On the one hand when the pupils are hungry they will not take care of the kind of the food that they eat and that makes them eat from these fast food restaurants without thinking that it not healthy or how much it costs of money, but if the fast food restaurants close in schools the pupils will take the healthy food from their house and this is a good thing.
On the other hand there should be a restaurant in every school because the pupils waste the day on the school and it will be a problem if they donâ€™t find anything to eat and to help them to learn.
but at all it is so hard to ban the fast food restaurant on schools and many people will disagree this and I see that from the number of people who eat from this restaurants.
