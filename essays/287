Tablet computers should become the primary way students learn in class. As a teachers we should be always be developing ourselves in better way. Now student are using mobiles and electronic devices almost all day, so it will be more enjoyable to the student using these things. Using tablet in classes make the student more focus and participating. I think schools should go for tablets because it's more fun, more economical and more developed than books.
