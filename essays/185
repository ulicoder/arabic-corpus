Many studies shown that student perform better at school when they get more sleep, before going to school. Which means that they claim if students start school at late hour they will do better in their educational obtaining promising outcomes. However, student can't perform better at school when starting late because it would make them irresponsible toward their classes and their education. Therefore, schools shouldn't start times be adjusted so that students get a lot of sleep.
Learning for late hours, to start and to finish only bring tiredness and anxiety, while if they start earlier they would be full of energy and actively.
As well as if they started early, they finish early and they can have the rest of the day free, which allow them to do so many things outdoors rather than school
Students will be irresponsible toward their classes and as a result to the late starting school they will take it for granted, and will stay up being awake all night, just because they believe they start school at late hour. Whereas, student must take school very serious, and be responsible and ware of the consequences of not being all focused and serious in classes.
Late start time can affect me in a very negative way, I personally would be very tired if I had to spend the whole day at school studying, and have my day lost just because I had to study at school for late hours. As a result I totally reject the idea of school starting at late hours.
