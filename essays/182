Recently, many girls believed that all-girl schools provide a better, more challenging atmosphere for them. Yet, they suppose that it prepare them in an educational and moral manners. According to my personal experience at school, mixed-sex students, in term of not only improving social relationships, but also improving and increasing the challenging atmosphere between both genders. Therefore, mixed-sex students in classrooms are best for obtaining promising educational outcomes, and lifestyle.
Containing two different gender in class prevent distinction between students. Both will be used to one another, which make it easier and comfortable to communicate together. Students are going to finish school with the knowledge, and consciousness how to deal with other people or handle a social relationship with the surrounding. Thus, mixed classes will provide and offer the opportunity to experience their real personality among being or dealing with other different people.
Mixed-sex classrooms provide a challenging atmosphere. Both students will be motivated and encouraged to participate, in order to show or approve that their gender is the best, as a result it will increase their stimulus to learn, and to make an effort to compete, in order to be the ones who are best in obtaining educational outcomes.
To conclude, since the world is all about diversity, it offers students to get to know that diversity which leads to less confusion and anxiety for them and less racism, based on their gender. Diversity teaches them to accept reach other. Furthermore, it teaches them to perceive a more realistic view of society, since life itself is diversity. It improve their behaviors, personality, and increase their self-confidence while being around different people which make them how their real person.
