In fact, this was the first time I had ever presented a novel I had never expected in my life, that I would be able to read and analyze a novel I have always read and enjoyed.
But now I felt the writer's feelings and the hard work in his novel
I felt the writer's feeling because I have put a lot of hard work in my novel and analyzing it.
While I'm doing my presentation I felt like Oh my god! when does this shit ends but when I finish it I said Oh my god again but at this time with a surprised face like how could we did this thing by ourselves (my partner and I).
Now I'm understanding how much doing a literature presentation is so important and necessary...
In my opinion, literature is so important also funnyâ€¦
For the first time, I like my presentation and what I have done, something I would want to change was explaining more and searching more and get deeper with the requirements to do an excellent presentation also put extra efforts on the presentation but like what I said it was my first time and I'm so proud of what I have done.
