"A teacherâ€™s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is an arguable statement, in which it is not easy to completely be for or against it.
Relating in basic social and emotional, yet professional, level to your student is a very important quality which should be in a 'good' teacher, despite that it is essential to remember that every teacher has a certain material and a knowledge he or she should pass to his students.
On one hand, teachers should not be robots who's their only job is to deliver materials of the subject they teach. On the other hand, they should not become social workers and neglect the fact they are trying to feed their students with more information and knowledge. For example, a tenth grade teacher, who relates well with his students but does not have an excellent knowledge in the subject, can actually be a reason the students having a hard time in the Bagrut exam.
Talking from a personal experience, having a not well updated, excellently acknowledgeable mathematics teacher in tenth grade, affected me throughout my high school studies, leading to me having mathematics as the lowest grade in my certificate, which was not pleasing to see, regardless of how my relationship with the teacher was.
It is a flaw in the teachers if they are not up to date with the subject they teach, especially on the level of being well informed and fully grasping the materials, yet it is very essential for them to be a combination, a well-mixed combination, of a professional teacher and an educator figure.
In conclusion, a teacher needs to be an easily approached, well informed figure, who's someone reliable and trusted by students, on educational as well as on a social emotional level.
