There are many reasons and facts that proved that young people enjoy life more than older people. Because younger people knows exactly how and when and with who they can enjoy and also no doubt that younger people have the strength to go out, play, party, travel, do exercises, and all the funny and entertainment activities, on the other hand older people known as they can't do this type of activities because they will get tired and their bones can't take pain every while. So they prefer most of the time to stay home and set with their families. Otherwise there's activities that is suitable for each age which means that there some point that when you get older you can't do things as you used to do when you were younger, each age has his own lifestyle.
Older people had been living their life when they used to be younger and we all know that while getting older you are exposed to get disease and your strength reduced. While younger people they be like loving to taste what life is and want to know and explore what the world. So that's also a fact that younger enjoy more than older because older people had this experience before so they wouldn't be excited to do it again and specially when they know that they can't do it and enjoy it one more time because they would be sick or whatever.
Younger people who have many friends like to go out and experienced new things together and wants to enjoy every minute together and they always have something to tell and places to go and to study and communication between them and others who are not with them, besides older people usually do not have so much friends they try to keep their family closer and most of the time with them in home.
So for all the facts and reasons I mentioned previously I totally agree that yes, younger people enjoy their life more than older do.
