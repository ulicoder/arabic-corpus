In last month we going to Intel company. That is one of the most developed companies in hi-tech. This trip was so wonderful to me because I learned a lot information of hi-tech. We toured around the company, and know for us jobs and parts in the company. Then we went to the mall and we ate and shopped there.
I like the company and all the trip but I didnâ€™t like the long lectures. This trip was very amazing and I enjoyed in it. I was very happy when I got back to home.
