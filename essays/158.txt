Getting a driving license is one of the most beneficial steps that I have done in my life. It helps me to transport easily from one place to another and makes my life easier and more comfortable as a woman.
Personally, I insist on getting the driving license by the age of 18, for several reasons: First it is much more safe, as at the age of 18 the person will be mature enough. Therefore, he/she will be more restricted to the driving safety rules. Second, teenagers at the age of 14, 15, 16, 17 tend to have irresponsible behaviors like smoking, drinking alcohol and having wrong friendships.
So I think that these instative circumstances will affect them and put them in danger while driving.
Finally, we are not only talking here about the driver's lives, but also the lives and safety of others. So it is very important for the driver to be mature enough to keep his life and lives of others.
