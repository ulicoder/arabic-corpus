Summer time is the most enjoyable time of the year. People always enjoy the warm weather, sun and fresh air. Summer is the time of happiness.
Summer holiday is for students to relax, be productive and enjoy quality time with their family without the stress of tasks and exams.
In addition, summer school is a great opportunity to work on subjects where achievements were low and improve. Plus, during summer sudents can participate in activities that they don't have the time for during school. They can study different language of even take part in sport event.
On the other hand, I do understand why some might think to shorten the summer holiday. Two months is a long time to not be at school and it might affect badly on students academically. Unfortunately, summer can be boring for some kids when they are not being productive. Sometimes, being bored can lead different kids into doing stupid and dangerous things in order to fill their time. Overall, I believe that summer holiday is a vital part of kids lives. Kids love the summer holiday and they look forward to it. It is the time for kids just to be kids.
