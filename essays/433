I know about "Clean Eating" and I have heard about it before reading the articles from my experience with diet.
I am following a diet since 3 years ago with clean eating and healthy food system. So I have read the same ideas that mentioned in the articles in Arabic before I started a serious diet with losing weight.
Being healthy and eating clean food is not easy, but it is important in the same time to keep our bodies in a good health. For that we have to follow certain kinds of diets that are suitable for each body and they have to be under professional dietician's observation, in order to take care of the body and not affect it in a bad way.
The first article: "why we feel for clean eating?"
This article talks about a girl who became orthorexia because of her wrong clean eating.
The article's purpose is to aware us from hurting our body because of clean eating dietary, and to explain for us what is the healthiest diets.
The second article "Too clean?" talks about ranging from a paleo approach to a general description of eating no processed foods. In other words changing food can be harmful.
And the third one "Clean eating goals you should know" talks about the right Â ways that we should follow in order to eat cleanly, and this will happen when we change the way we buy and store our foods, we need to be smart and sensible.
To sum up, clean eating means changing lifestyles.
