My pupils sometimes observe English movies on the TV. They pass some words eventually through the class, most times they are not aware of these words' meanings. Because of that, I got upset and sometimes I show unsatisfaction. The most popular word is "fuck off".
The main problem is the way I could explain this word in Arabic. Moreover, if I show them how this word is unacceptable they automatically repeat it. Then I think sometimes I should be clever to ignore it.
