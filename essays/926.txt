It is not easy to learn or study a foreign language because it requires an effort, free time and in some cases: extra money.
People might learn a foreign language in three ways which I find most helpful and beneficial: taking lessons with a private tutor, taking lessons as part of a class, going to live in a country where the language is spoken.
For each way from the list above there are advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of taking lessons with a private tutor are lots: you are alone which is more quiet than being with a group of people, you also have all the attention and the observance of your tutor, it is quiet and that gives you the chance to ask or to clarify things that are not clear for you. But also this way of learning needs lots of money because you are taking private lessons.
Regarding the second way of learning a foreign language, which is taking lessons as part of a class, the advantages are: you can share and as questions or information with other colleagues, it costs you less money but sometimes it might be noisy because there might be a large number of students with you in class. The advantages of the third way (going to live in a country where the language is spoken) which I find the most effective one are: the majority of people speak that language where you go, so it is gives you the chance to live and feel the language, besides, all the signs and information are written in that specific language. The disadvantages are lots also: you must leave your homeland and put everything behind you, including your family and your relative, you must leave your work and your career in order to establish a new life, thing that is not easy to do at all.
In order to sum up all the ideas that discussed above, I will say, it is fun and interesting to learn a foreign languages besides the ones you already know but at the same time it needs also lots of encourage, patient, effort, time and money in some cases.
