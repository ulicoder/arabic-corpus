Paper books were published several years ago. Therefore, people got use to paper books because many years ago paper books were the only books in the library, unlike the e-books that were published recently. In this paper I intend to talk about why paper books are better than the e-books.
Nowadays, we have the e-book that may be used by the reader rather than the paper books. It might be because the reader can read the book online. The readers might prefer to read a books by the phone or by the computer, which it might be easy for the readers. According to PWC Consulting (2019) "found that in 2018, e-book sales were higher than print book sales in US and UK". This point leads us to the fact that the e-books is used by the readers rather than the paper books.
On the other hand, some readers, especially the old readers may find that, the paper books is quite easy for them to read. It may be because that paper books is easy to access for the readers. Moreover, there are some readers with disabilities that may find tactile a phone or a computer hard for them. In this context, Helm, Ligon, Stovail and Van Riper (2018), "US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided."
To sum up, paper books are extremely easy than the e-books. Colleges, universities and many readers cannot give up on paper books in order to use e-books. Paper books may lead to better learning.
