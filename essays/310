Women earn less computer science degrees, that could be explained according to the fact that many schools do not integrate teaching computer science. Thus, many students get lost after they graduate and they find it hard to decide which topic should they study at college, hence, they tend to apply to more common topics that they can relate to.
In my opinion, the society plays an important role in such a phenomena, since many parents and I could relate to this from personal experience do not motivate their daughters to pursue to such careers due to the fact that there are special places and environment to such careers, such as computers and they are usually placed in the city. As a result some women might find it hard to apply to such careers, since they need to travel and deal with the other sex. Pursuing to careers in computering and tech could be a problem to women in less-progressed societies which have specific perspectives and beliefs towards working women.
