Homework is an important element in the education field, due to the fact that it is a way to engage the students in the topics, which they are studying and accordingly, to motivate them and to give them an aim to review the material they have studies previously.
Students need to review the material in order to stick it in their minds, hence, homework offers the students the opportunity to do so. However, many people might consider homework as a pointless aim, which only adds pressure to the students, especially when student have spent their whole day studying at school.
However, homework in my opinion is a crucial element, and a necessary one that should be included in all of the education systems, since it helps the students to keep in track. Moreover, it offers the teachers the options to review the material with the students on the beginning of the lesson and to check her or his student's comprehension of a certain material before moving to another topic.
When the students take homeworks, they are actually applying the material they studied individually, thus, homework could be considered as a beneficial practice for the sake of students to check their understanding, whether they face difficulties in certain points, to check if they have questions about it, etc. This process is necessary for the students in order to assess themselves, and to be capable to realize their strength and weaknesses in a certain topic.
To sum up, homework is an important element which works on developing the students' abilities and skill, moreover, it guides the teacher towards her or his lessons and to know how to move forward.
