Well, I think that we should focus our attention to this idea because I do believe that single gender schools may be more comfortable place for both teachers and girls.
Firstly, it is more easier to deal with girls as a female teacher in a classroom. You can understand them and maybe help them overcome many obstacles that they may face. Also girls feel more confidence and perform better in such schools because they don't feel the pressure of gender roles and may accept any criticism from the same biological sex.
Furthermore, it will be more relaxed environment because there is no necessary to prove something to the same gander. I mean that boys and girls in traditional schools, try all the time to prove something to the opposite biological sex, and that may cause some troubles.
Finally, if the single-gender schools identified with an improvement in the girls' perform in school so we have to think seriously in this model of schools.
