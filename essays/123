There are English words that I do not like and I try not to use them. I even tell my students not to use them. For example, slang words. Students tend to use slang words when they talk and when they have a writing assignment. Students use the word "gonna" a lot. I immediately stop them and ask them to say "I am going to". The problem is that some student think that slang is the correct and formal use of the word. They are not aware that in formal writing we do not use slang. Others, don't even know that certain slang words are actually slang. They used to hear these words over and over and they think that these are regular words to use at any time. My students use words like "OMG", "WTF", and "tnx". Teenagers often use these expressions when they are texting each other. They have common abbreviations that distinguish them. I even use them when I am chatting or texting my friends. But, I tell my students that it is not recommended to use those words when they write. Also, not to write them in the Bagrut exam.
