Starting class time is topic that is discussed among both students and teachers as well. Some teachers and students think that students perform better when they start early because they are able to concentrate more and they are not tired yet. However, some others think that it is difficult to wake up early and do not enough time for sleep. I think that starting early is better, and I support the first opinion because it is easier and better to concentrate and be active during the earlier day time of the day and also, in this case, to finish school earlier.
Students have the chance to get advantage of the rest of the day and to do other activities and jobs that they are not able to do if they finish school late.
