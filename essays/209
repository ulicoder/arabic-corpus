The fact that some studies found that school students perform better when the classes start later seems to be strange to me. It is not so convincing for me, since I am that person who perform better usually at the very early hours in the morning. However, it could be true for many other people who cannot be active at this hours.
Starting classes later is good to be adjusted, only if there were several researches that prove that the majority of the students perform better. Further, I'm sure that there are people who are more active and perform better at earlier hours of the day. Therefore, the researches should provide statistics for people who perform better at earlier hours of the day and people who perform better at later hours.
In my opinion, each school needs to adjust the start time that is suitable for the majority of its students.
If I'm talking about myself, starting at a later time would affect me negatively, since I will lose the time in which I perform the best.
Finally, I believe that this topic is controversial, since people are different, so not everyone share the same activity at the same times. Therefore, schools should try to adjust different start time for each semester and compare the students' performance, and to give its student equal chances for success.
