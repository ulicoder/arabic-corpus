Later school start time. Some studies found that school students perform better when the classes start later. Everyone has always hated getting up super early to go to school.
As a teacher and a student I do not like going to school that early in the morning (7:30 am).
The amount of sleep that we get is important, students need a good amount of sleep to be able to focus and get through the school day. Students ability to function during school is impacted by quantity, regularity, and quality of their sleep.
