The teacher should have the ability not just to knowledge the subject the taught but also and that the most important in my opinon to know how to relate with student and how to engage with them.
The teachers have the responsibility to know how deal with the student, the can't deal with all of the them the same, because in every class there are different type of them and they should know how to deal with each one of them like if the have an excellent student the can't deal with the whole class at the level.
If you been asked... Do you prefer your student to come out from class with so much or the knowledge and information and they forget it immediatly came out with less knowledge but they understand it more.
Of course every one of us prefer the second one because being ability to know the way that are suitable and the best for the student have more meaning and more important than just give information.
