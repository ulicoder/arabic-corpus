I think in my opinion the most theory that makes sense is the bow-wow theory.
It is the primitive words could have been imitations of the natural wounds which early men and women heard around them.
I think we can talk and we know words from the talking around us .
Like we learned how to talk from the words we heard when we were little and when we weren't know anything about talking and when words wasn't exist in our world , so I think women and men before us (like when they discover the language ) they discovered from he sounds they heard around them so that is how they know the words.
For example: when they heard noises the sounds around them was like "buzz" so they knew that when they hear "buzz" it is a noise around them.
Like when we were babies when we hear a sound like "waa" we knew that there is someone crying so when whe wanted to cry we were making a sound like "waa".
So in my opinion the most theory that makes sense is the "bow-wow" theory.
