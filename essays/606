Reflection on my presentation.
Strong points in the presentation:
I knew the story by heart which considered a part of fluently presenting.
Being with a partner such as Hadeel makes me feel relaxed while speaking because I know that when I do a mistake she will automatically correct me which what she really did in many times, also she helped me in remembering the missing word such as the characters and what happens next in the story.
The slides in the Power Point motivated me while speaking because the theme and the pictures of it depict the story mood.
I really felt confident while speaking as if I was telling the story to a best friend and I wasn't afraid of making mistakes, everything was going spontaneously.
Weak points in the presentation:
I had many pronunciation mistakes such as: choose instead of chose â€“ short video without an article etc..
In some places I was hesitating I felt that when my voice has dropped.
When I clicked at the short video link it didn't work.
There are two students that didn't participate very well in the activity.
What I should do in the future:
I should work harder at my pronunciation.
I should check everything is fixed before I start presenting.
I should do an activity which has more options to choose so it can suit all the students in the class.
