To make your life interesting and full of adventure, you have to put many goals for the future and work hard to achieve them. I have so many goals to achieve I'm working hard to succeed in the school and to be a kids' doctor in the future, and I want to visit France too. In the future, I want to live in my own lovely house. I'll work hard as much as I can to achieve my goals.
