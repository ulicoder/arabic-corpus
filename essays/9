I think single-sex schools has positive and negative effect on girls learning in such schools. In one hand, it allows girls to be concentrated on learning and studying. They will learn out of the willing to study and not to impress the other sex. It also allows girls to be more sympathetic to one another, to support and help one another. On the other hand, learning in single-sex school, won't let girls be familiar on how to deal with the other half of the society, boys. They might be concentrated on studying and not being able to learn how to cooperate with this partner.
I think going to school of the two sexes, boys and girls, prepares girls to the wider society, college and work.
I believe that single-sex school shouldn't be an obstacle for girls to promote or succeed in school. It should be a stimulation for girls, encouraging and challenging element to get the benefit of it.
