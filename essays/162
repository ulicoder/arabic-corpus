Long time ago schools used to teach students using typical paper books. But now, with the huge technological bombshell that invaded the earth planet, it all changed. Schools started a new teaching methodology which is the information and communication technology ICT. Most schools mix ICT with the typical teaching methods giving a priority to the ICT.
Using e-books in schools and universities is a very beneficial teaching resource. It offers students the opportunity to study and use books freely with a very cheap price. Showing the book in screen is also very attractive for the new generation as all the world around them is connected to computers and technological screens. Therefore, learners will have a satisfying reading experience.
Adopting e-books to different languages is considered a very important source as well. Each learner can have his suitable version of the same book written in the language that he/she prefers. So learners tend to use e-books more than paper books. PWC Consulting (2019) found that in 2018, e-books sales were higher than print books sales in US and UK. Moreover, learners seek a change, so they find e-books as a different style of the same materials and this is very interesting and attractive.
However, some researchers found reverse results upon using e-books. In the study by Helm, Ligon, Stovall, and Van Riper (2018), participating US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided. Learners need to feel the books and to smell them in order to have a meaningful learning. Moreover, learners learn by writing also on the books, highlighting and writing a summarizing tips which supports and reinforces the learning process.
Personally, I prefer the typical paper books as they are "eternal", they can hold for ages and ages, so paper books are very previous and valuable.
Learners learn more deeply if they activate all their senses.
