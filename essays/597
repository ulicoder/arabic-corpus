Reflection on the presentation:
In my presentation, I talked about a story, which is called “The story on an hour”. I recited the story to the students in an easy way to ensure their understanding. The PowerPoint was well organized; it included pictures and a diagram, which made the presentation clear and enjoyable for the students. Even though I was a little bit nervous at the beginning, which caused to a few grammatical mistakes, I think that I was not aware of these mistakes. I made an eye contact, which is a very important thing and moved in front of the class, I explained in my own words what was written in the PowerPoint; however, next time I will pay attention to time by using a timer because it was a short presentation. In addition, next time I will not prepare the PowerPoint before the lesson begins because I had enough time to prepare it during the lesson. I will ask the students more questions, which can make them, laugh such as “imagine that your husbands have died and you are free now, what would do?” I believe that the creative teacher is the best teacher, because using new methods and creating great activities such as singing, acting, asking interesting questions that require deep thinking can ensure the students understanding and make the lesson more interesting. Being creative is a unique quality that drags the students’ attention, since the most important factor in education is the teacher who helps the students in shaping their identities. In this presentation, I saw my weak and strong points; I learned many things for the future. I am going to work harder on improving the weak points, and I am going to promote the strong points.
