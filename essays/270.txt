I agree with this statement, because sometimes we can find part of teachers who are not qualified to be teachers and stand in front of the pupils and teach them. In some cases pupils back to home and they facing a difficulties to do their homework, when you ask them, why can't you do your homework? His answer is, because I can't understand what the teacher taught us in the class.
This can be due to the methods that the teacher is using while explaining. It does not work the traditional way teacher must use an attractive ways to attract the students and make them learn without feeling that this topic is boring or hard.
So, to conclude, students have the right to evaluate their teachers, in order to make the teachers enhance a little bit of their ways in teaching according to the students needs.
