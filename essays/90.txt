Summer vacation is an excellent opportunity for the whole members of the family to spend a valuable time together.
Therefore I believe that a long vacation will be good for all of us. We can get the chance to sit down and relax with the ones we care about. In addition, we will have longer time to spend amusing time. This will give us an adequate time to visit our favorite sites, and spend a peaceful and tranquil minutes observing the sunset. Summer vacation gives the chance for our children to get involved in camps and do an activity that they wouldn't normally do during the year, our normal schedules as a family is changed. Therefore I think that it would be wonderful if they extended the summer vacation.
