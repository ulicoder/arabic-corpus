In recent years, technology becomes more common in schools, especially tablet computers. schools started to replace tablet computers with textbooks, this issue have to different side, one could be negative side and the other is positive.
Students show more interaction in class when they use technology, because it is more enjoyable for them, it is not as the traditional way, according to Singer and Alexander (2016) found that students enjoyed more in class when they use tablet computers. I agree with this, but I saw that this learning can effect in negative way, they just enjoy, but they do not actually learn, as a result there is no serious benefit for the students.
In the other hand, tablet computers more helpful and make the achievements of the students more higher, it might be because using computers becoming more common and help them focus more. There are different research that support this point such as Harcourt (2011) founded that using computers increase the scores 20% in one year compared to traditional way.
To conclude, technology has two sides, one is negative and the other is positive. I think if our students use it in the right way, it will help them to score more in tests and to have active learning as well.
