the first article "12 clean eating goals you should know" this article shows 12 clean eating goals which support you to have a clean eating style and to be more healthy. These goals keep us safe healthy and better eater.
the secound article "why we feel clean eating" i strongly recommend to this article be tought at schools for its strong meanful and goal, this article shows us the importance of eat cleanly and take care of our cleaning eat, a story of a girl whose her hair failed because of the unclean eating is shown in the article as a very strong evidence for the importance of the clean eating.
the last article is "too clean" this article shows how unaware are we when we eat with careless about the cleaness of the food or the kitchen where the food are made in, and it shown why and how we have to be more aware.
