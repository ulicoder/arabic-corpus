Environmental activists have been demanding paper book producer to shut down the manufacturing of paper books to save as many tree as possible. In my opinion, paper books have an essential role in the experience of reading and they cannot be replaced by e-books.
Our world is constantly changing and so are people's needs. We live in an are of constant evolution and development and people nowadays rarely have time to relax and read a book. However, people who manage to find the time and energy to invest in reading a book need a paper book to make the whole experience of reading a book complete. It is very difficult for a person who is used to feel the pages with their fingers, to start reading from a screen. the whole idea of quality time goes to waste.
According to a study conducted by Helm, Ligon, Stovall, and Van Riper (2018), participating US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided. In recent years, people have been overwhelmed with technological innovation that is meant to make lives easier. Consequently, people have become addicted and connected to their screens most of the time during the day. Therefore, people should take a break from their screens and enjoy reading a paper book using the conventional way which turns the reading experience into an enriching experience.
However, PWC Consulting (2019) found that in 2018, e-books sales were higher than print book sales in US and UK. These statistics are indicative of the vast use of technological products and how technology has enslaved people somehow and turned them into blind user of its products. It is true that e-books can be more accessible and easier to handle, but they forbid the reader from experiencing the true value of reading a book.
In conclusion, people should be granted the virtue of choice. Many people still prefer to read a paper book rather than an e-book.
