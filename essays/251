Computer science is a thriving subject, other than the material aspect, computer scientists are known for their intelligence, high skills and dedication to their line of work. Nowadays technology is on top of the pyramid in our lives, having such a high position only makes computer science more important and essential. Which directly sheds the light on computer science learners and certificates owners. In this paper I intend to discuss the current drop of female computer scientists in the US compared to the mid-80s.
Pop culture discrimination, pop culture portrayals scientists as while or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows such as "The Big Bang Theory". The influence TV and society have on a person thoughts and discussion making this case as a primary suspect in the issues the drip of female computer science degrees.
Discouragement of family and mentors; it's not surprising that family and school staff play a huge roles in our career choices, nowadays girls are not encouraged to enter science fields which comes as a reflection of the first cause in the meaning of that it will only label her as a nerd or a geek, which in turn made girls afraid of taking this risk and joining the science field.
As a conclusion, many factors interfere with the drop of female computer science degree, but society and pop culture are the lead causes preventing females from pursuing a career in this field.
