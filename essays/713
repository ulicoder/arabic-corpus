Many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center, some people think that this is a good idea and some people didnâ€™t like it. In my opinion, this is a very good idea, because it has many benefits. Firstly, banning cars from entering the city center very good, this thing maybe will reduces the accidents, the possibility of running over a person is a great possibility, so banning cars will reduces this phenomenon.
Secondly, banning cars from entering will reduces car's use, and if use of cars is reduced, air pollution is also reduced because these cars emit toxic gases, so this will reduce the risk of pollution and poisoning.
In the end I think that must to banning cars from entering the city center, to maintain the safety of people.
