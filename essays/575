There are some people who think that a teacher's ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, and I believe that both knowledge and communication are important.
Let me start by saying that the communication between the teacher and the student plays a great roll in the educational system, because it is clear to us that if the teacher can relate with his students easily and they understand each other's abilities and qualifications, the result is much more better because this way students can easily ask for help and they won't be ashamed, and for sure the teacher is always aware of his students difficulties and he is working on them. As human being we are known as communicational creatures, we live and evolve due to talking, hearing, listening and understanding and that is the main issue, let us not forget about the importance of knowing the subject and its material so well, because what is the use of a good communication if it's not for a better learning? So for me I think that the first step of getting an excellent educational results is to focus on the communications between teachers and students and then we can focus on the subjects and the materials that needs to be taught, both these steps should not be underestimated because for sure this is the recipe for a successful student.
