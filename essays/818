I think that " yo - hey - ho" is the most theory that makes sense, it's a about the sounds that people make during their physical activities - hums, grunts, groans. I strongly believe in this theory because I do see those interactions weekly, for example when I eat a tasty food with my friends in the school, and they want to express how much they do like it, the sounds that I hear from them it's like : "hum", they do it whenever the food is so tasty and they like it so much. I do know some people who have the sound of grunts every night when it's time to sleep, it's s annoying, but they can do nothing with it , they can't stop it , and I have a friend who has that sound whenever he feels sick, it's kind of more comfortable for him to make that sound by himself in order to feel better and it lessens the pain that he feels.  when it comes to groans ,  I actually listen it daily from most of people, they say "ah" instead of yes. it's an expression for different feelings too , people make a sound make a deep inarticulate sound in response to pain or despair. All of these sounds are way or a language to human to express themselves. It's a daily ineractions that all of people around me used to do, so that's why I believe that this theory is the most logical one and it really makes sense.
