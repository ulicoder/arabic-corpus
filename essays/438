I never heard before about clean eating when I start reading the articles thought  it's the same as diet but after I read the articles I found out that it's not the same thing because clean eating is a lifestyle not just for few months like diet, when we lose the weight we can stop the diet, I can define a clean eating like this taking out all additives, you want to stick to natural foods and not the processed options you can get in stores. All food should offer health benefits.
In my opinion there should be more aware of this phenomenon and more people should adopt it in their lives, because it ensures us a healthy lifestyle, the problem is when people misunderstand this phenomenon and hurt themselves instead of making their lives healthier for example in the first article "why we fell for clean eating", Gordan Younger publisher of a book about clean eating and at the end she was suffering from a serious eating disorder: orthorexia, an obsession with consuming only foods that are pure and perfect.
I liked the article "12 clean eating goals" because it gives us advices how we can adopt clean eating and make it our lifestyle with easy steps, the steps are possible for everyone to do ensuring us to eat healthy with doing little exercises.
I am in general against eating fast food, I prefer to eat healthy food but I never tried clean eating, for example, eating a raw food, I think this phenomenon well stay around for many years and I wish well be a more reasonable ingredients that everyone could use and find easily and then I will be the first who adopt this lifestyle.
