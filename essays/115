Single-sex schools as known as single gender education is where male and female students attend separate schools or classes. In my opinion, single-sex schools may help the girls or boys to have better academic grades and better discipline. Furthermore, boys and girls in this kind of schools may pay more attention on classes than in the mixed cooperated schools. In addition, it will be more comfortable for the two genders which give the students's the encourage to participate in the class.
Overall, I think it is helpful to be study in a single-sex schools...
