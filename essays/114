I will talk about the e-book which is more popular than paper book. In the study of PWC Consulting (2019) found that 2018 e-book sales were higher than print book sales in US and UK.
There are advantages for the e-book. It is not heavy to carry it. You can download the book which you decide to read anywhere. You don't think if you forget the book or not. The only disadvantage of the e-book, you cannot touch and smell the paper which is more important part in your reading a book. In the study by Helm, Ligon, Stovall, and Van Riper (2018) mentioned that participating US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided.
I prefer to read a book and to buy a book. it is very interesting to smell the new papers of the book. It is enjoyable to touch every paper when you read.
