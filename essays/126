I believe that homework is necessary when needed but it should not be exaggerated. For example, when the teacher teaches a new topic that was not completely explained in the classroom, homework here is necessary. Or when she sees that some pupils are finding it hard to understand everything that she explains, short homework will be useful here too. I don't have kids to talk about but I can talk about my own experiences from the past. Some mathematics homework were really very useful for me. Other homework was just a waste of time. I didn't remember that it affected my educational level or my level of understanding at all.
In my opinion each classroom or school must have its own policy regarding homework. Homework for all topics must not take more than an hour to do. Studying is not everything in life. Students need to acquire other skills that are very essential for their survival in this world.
