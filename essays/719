I was returning from school to home after a long day in school and when I was walking with my classmate, I saw an old woman want to get into the car and she have a thing in her hands and can't open the door of the car and in that I got to the car and open the door for the old lady and she smiled to me and said thanks then I smiled and felt good about it, helping people is a good thing, and it give us a good feeling because you make people life easier and happy.
And when you did some thing good in life you will record this thing. In a hot day I was playing in the playground of the village and when I was playing, I hit and get my leg, and I did not tell to anyone to give me a ride to home but in the middle of the road some guy give me a ride to the hospital and take care of me, in that time my dad came to the hospital and thank the guy for doing this.
