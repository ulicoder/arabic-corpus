I disagree with this statement “Young people enjoy life more than older people do” because it is not about age it is only about how we make our happiness also how we enjoy ourselves in life without look at our age.
Old people have more knowledge and wisdom, they can handle with things better than young people who have no enough experience in life.
Young people waste the opportunities afforded by youth.
They don’t know what to do with their time. They don’t know how to enjoy life, by implication, conversely, the elderly know all about enjoying life, but are troubled by arthritis.
Age is only a number, a person can create happy and enjoy life without considering about his age and thinking about death.
