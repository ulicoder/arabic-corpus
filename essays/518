First of all, there is difference between young and older people. Young people are often searching for fun and always wants to enjoy their time with friends or family no matter what. But do they enjoy life more than older people?
Every age has its meaning of enjoying, and also there is many obstacles that prevent people to have fun. For example: young people have the power and the energy to enjoy them life, to travel and to do several things. But they don’t have enough money or time to do that. Not only the young people have many obstacles, also the old people. There is no energy to travel or to enjoy their life. sometimes they are having a health problem and can't do what young people can do.
The meaning of the word "enjoy" is different between young and old people. Me as a teenager the meaning of the word enjoy is travelling with friends, to go out, watch movies with friends, car racing. But I don’t think that old people enjoy the same things I enjoy, and I'm sure that I won't enjoy the things they have fun to do.
In my opinion, the younger people enjoy their life more that the older people, because there is no limit in their thoughts. They won't think about the things they will do, if they right or wrong, or if its accepted to the community. They just enjoy every minute without thinking about the punishment or what other people will think or talk about. I hope that when I will be older I won't be like those old people, I want to enjoy every minute with my family and friends no matter what.
