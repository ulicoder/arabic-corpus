I don't agree with the idea of evaluating teachers by their students. If we talk about schools - not college or university - students will not evaluate the teacher according to his skills or his way of teaching, but they will evaluate their likable teacher as a good teacher and the unlikable teacher as "a not good teacher" so their feedback will not be fair about the skillful teacher.
I can suggest an alternative solution: instead of evaluating teachers, the principal has to put box next to his room, so any students has any problem or anything to say about teach, he/she can write on a sheet of paper and put it in the box.
For conclusion, evaluating teachers has to be professional not emotional.
