The article shows us what is "filter Bubble" means, and show a new and interesting points side of view about social media that all the time around us and affects our lives and stealing our time without warning us or without realizing what's happened.

Not just what we asked to see or to know. So, you choose to know a new information that you didn't need! Then we choose what filter Bubble decide for us what to see. so, where is our privacy?! everything we see on YouTube, for Example, everyone knows what I prefer to see! and they take pieces of information about us every time we decide to enter in the social media.
I think that filter Bubble gives us a knowledge but on the other side it effects negative to our lives, and make everyone visit our privacy. The most amazing thing that I notice in the article that the writer criticized many points in a perfect way and use many Examples from our lives that's aware the readers to not to fall in "filter Bubble" ways.
The article shows us that we may be victims between the real lives and the web lives. We realized that there is a mystery live hide behind the internet sites, a world that we can't see it, we talk with it and share with it our privacy but, we didnâ€™t see it, we have to be careful.
The most suitable way to make the filter Bubble disappear is to clean our computer and phone history all the time.
