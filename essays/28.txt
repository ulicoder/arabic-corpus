As a teacher, I enjoy the long stretch of summer vacation and I'm really with the idea for many reasons. First, vacations make you feel that your work seem easier. Secondly, vacations make you happier with your entire life - you feel more free and control on your life. In addition, vacations help people's calm They will not think of anything but how to keep fresh and happy.
In the end, I am waiting my vacation to live the free, happiness, and love.
