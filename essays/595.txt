As I look back on my presentation and the preparation that when into it I see that I have learned a lot of things from this one small exercise. This was my first presentation about explaining a short story so it was for me a little challenging, to try to mention all the points that the lecturer said.
It took me a week to finish the presentation and to cover everything from all the aspects.
In this presentation I did it on the short story winter dreams by F. Scott Fitzgerald, I introduced the presentation by reading the summary of this short story because my classmates did not know this story before so I first to explain it for them.
I did my presentation on the Power-Point program, it needed a lot of work to develop the slide to make sure that it contains everything that we needed to include.
I did the structure of the presentation as the lecturer told us to do, it was important to make it like this to have a connection between each slide.
The only problem that I have at this point that I did the plot structure in circles, in future slides to do it in a shape of triangle it is more understandable.
finding the information to this short story it was not that hard because I found a lot of information about this story, the hard part was to summarize the information and to not mention other details, but in my opinion my presentation from the material point of view was well covered.
The delivery of the presentation was good. The presentation could have been better, I was a little nervous in the beginning but later on, I got excited and felt relaxed, I think the solution to this problem is to practice more in the future.
