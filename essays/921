In my opinion, all the aspects given have much importance to learn any language. However, I think that when you want to learn a language, it is very important that you contact and communicate with others. For instance, taking lessons as a part of class is very efficient, since you can learn from others and listen to their accent. You can learn new vocabulary, thus, express yourself with different expressions.
Yet, you need to have courage to interact in class, not to be shy of making mistakes and believing that this is the way to accomplish progress.
Another way which I consider to be effective in acquisition of foreign language is to take online classes. This way you can be exposed to more dialects and meeting and interacting with many people from all around. Nevertheless, you have to be certain that these classes are taught by professional tutors and they are doing their job appropriately. Going to live in a country where the language is spoken, I believe it is the best way to learn the language. This process allows you to meet local people and learn their spoken language. You can also learn slangs and all kinds of expressions which you can add to the academic study of the language itself.
Consequently, you will get better results, you know the formal language which you learnt in classes, on the other hand, you have the spoken, less formal one. However, a person must be aware that this way might coast him extra expenses, which he has to consider before he takes such a step.
Although what has been discussed above, in my point of view as a teacher, a person should make personal effort and motivate himself to improve his language skills by getting more exposed to the language through reading because practice makes perfect.
