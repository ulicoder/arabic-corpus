A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent of the subject being taught. Well yeah I agree with this statement because the is not only a teacher.
The teacher who just only pass the class without any moral spirit he won't attracts his students to the class, so the students won't like his lesson and they will hate the lesson and the teacher too.
But in the other hand, the who pass the class with a moral spirit , the students will love him and will Wait for his lesson eagerly. In my opinion there is a lot of ways that the teacher can make his students love him and love his lesson, for instance: a teacher who pass his lesson by an activate or doing something which is not boring is more lovable by the students from the other teachers.
I think that the teacher should be a friendly teacher , who can talk to the students about his life or anything but learning, the student will always resort to him if he have a personal problem and trust me this teacher the students will remember him for ages.
I have been a students once, I really don't remember anything that I have learned. But I do remember my teachers who helped all the time in my difficult relations because we had a good relationship.
I am going to be a teacher soon, so I really want my students to remember me this way. And I will do my best to help them and to build a good relationship between us.
