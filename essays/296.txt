All-girl schools are schools where all the students are girls, and there are no boys students at all. The idea of having only girls in the classroom might be benevolent for the girls' scholastic achievement. However, I think that this might lead also to hard future consequences.
First, girls who learned in a single-sex school may find it more difficult to fit in workplaces later than girls who learned in a mixed-gender schools. When girls get used to communicate with girls only for the whole school period, and suddenly they graduate from school and got to either university or work where they have to communicate with boys or men too, it would be hard for them to get used to that.
Moreover, the mixed-gender classrooms might have special benefits for the students. For example, girls and boys may learn from differences they have.
To sum up, all-girls schools might be a good idea for the period of the school it would be useful for them. But, whenever they finish school, they will find / face difficulties because of that.
