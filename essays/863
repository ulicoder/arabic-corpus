Homework is useful or not? Homework improves pupils achievement in terms of improved grades, test results, and the likelihood to attend.
Too much homework can be harmful. It helps to reinforce learning and develop good study habits and life skills.
I think that homework is a good thing, there is a lot of reasons why homework is good, especially for pupils. First, doing homework teaches you (the pupils) how to learn on your own and work independently. Second homework is a good opportunity to connect parents and classmates. Finally, it might be teaches responsibility.
The pupils must not need a lot of homework. Each day there will be three homeworks and it must be short, because homework is an essential part of learning the subject matter.
I think that pupils need homework in order to help move a long in the lesson. Children need time to relax and take their minds off study. Homework can cause conflict between children and parent, and a lot of homework can stress the child.
At the end, first of all learning is an important thing and the teach must to be kind with the pupils, if the pupil love the subject and the teacher he/she will do all the things that she need, thus the important role for the teacher to make the lesson very nice and the pupil like it.
