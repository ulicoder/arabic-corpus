Homework is an important issue to talk about.
Although, I was a student at school once, and I didn't like doing homework, but it is important.
Homework help students to review materials they have learned at class. When students review materials and do their homework, they will know what problems do they have or what parts should they work on with the teacher in class. It benefits students because, then they would solve their problems and difficulties before the exam come.
Another point is that homework, in some way, develop responsibilities.
When a students knows that he has homework to do, and he does it on time, this shows how a student is responsible and develops his responsibility.
Too much homework can cause hatred of school and subjects for students. Because, 3-4 homework per a day can kill the kids free time and they won't be able to do and participate in other activities like sports. Homework have advantages and disadvantages, but still it is important for the teachers to keep up with their students and help them. Also, important for students themselves to study at home and help themselves.
