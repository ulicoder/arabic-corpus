If I want to choose a season as if my favorite one, then I would choose summer.
I like summer the most because in summer the day is longer than in winter, so I can advantage it and do a lot of activities with my small family.
In summer, we usually go out and travel more than in winter, because the weather is hot and nice, we don't have to put on lots of clothes, we feel more free than in winter.
And besides, there are some activities we cannot do in winter, such as camping, swimming, playing in the backyard of the house and many more.
I love summer and it's my favorite season of the year.
