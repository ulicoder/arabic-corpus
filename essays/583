In our decade, our behavior more important than anything, we must know how to communicate well with others for having a good and blessing life.
So of course I agree that the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject, and if we go back in our memory we can see from our scholar history that we were love to learn more with the teacher who were respect us and who treated us well also who give us the material we need in a good modern way, also there is a lot of known statistic shows that when the student feel comfortable with his teacher he will attracted randomly to the subject and his grades will be more higher.
And in my free time I sit down with my little brother and review with him the subjects that he learns in the school and when I ask him why he can't understand a specific material he tells me that the teacher who learn him is bad or aggressive and he talks fast and they can't understand him will, so in my opinion if this issue relate to me and because I'm a first year student in the English education and from the lectures that I watched and from the books that I have read it I'm finally understand that the student or the person can't reply or transact or even dealing with if you don’t have the attracted or even the good words that you must use it in the your behaving way also if you don’t have the beautiful or at least the acceptable way in teach you will not succeed in the you job,
Also in my first priorities the successful will come to you if you have the good physical ability and if you have a good space for expressing the ideas in your minds, and a lot of people have told me that I will be a successful teacher if I hold this thought for the rest of my life.
