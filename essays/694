I would like to describe the job that I want in the future. I have a big dream and it is to become a computer engineer, this job needs so many things.
You need to have five points with high grade in math.
The people who works in this job work 8 hours a day. You can make so much money from this job.
This job is very enjoyable because you work in front of a computer. You donâ€™t need to do physical work.
Couple days ago I read in the internet that this job is now the best job and all the companies are searching for workers. I hope in the future I work for a company called Intel because the job I talked about is the best job.
