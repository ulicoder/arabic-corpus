As every presentation, I felt a little bit nervous, but I can see that by time it minimizes. It is not because I am not sure or confident about the material, I know that I spent a lot of time and effort in order to make it perfect and don't miss a thing, but it's because I'll get graded on it and it has a high percentage, second because my teacher (you) was observing me and taking notes. And not to forget that there were a lot of students in the classroom. In addition to the fact that I didn't read from the board/slides, so I had to make sure I say everything and don’t forget a thing.
And as you said in the end of the presentation, you said that I wasn't that happy or cherish. I also realized that, and I hope that in the next course with you you'll see me reacting differently. I was like that because a lot of students were talking, which I made me uncomfortable, because I was trying to explain my presentation to them, and because I was nervous before, my facial expressions weren’t that good, I admit.
But although all these facts, I think I managed eventually to explained everything I had to explain, after telling them to pay attention, I didn't quit and continued talking while they weren't listening. Every time I realized that I had lost their attention, I called them by their names.
I hope that in the next courses with you you'll be more pleased about me.
