I totally agree with the statement which suggest that young people enjoy life more than older people.
Because, I think that young people like to exploit every beautiful moment in their life and enjoy it, since they think that the most important thing in their life is to find their happiness in everything they do, it can be in their work, family, hobbies etc. Young people like also to try new thing that has come to the world which was not existed before that they will probably like it and enjoy it. While older people do not like to try new things because they do not think like young people. Also old people have more things to take care of and responsibilities, not like young people.
Furthermore, usually parents think about their children's happiness more than theirs, they want them to be happy and enjoy everything they are doing, and sometimes they prohibit their self from things to give them to their children so they be satisfied.
There is kind of people that like to stay at home without doing anything or reading books, watching TVâ€¦ Unlike young people who hang out a lot with friends, go to parties etc. So in this way of living they do not enjoy their life, maybe how they think they are enjoying it, but in general or how we think they are not.
I also think that old people should enjoy their life and enjoy everything they are doing because enjoying the life effect on people's health, feelings and their motivation to work, hang out or do some things. When someone is enjoying his life he will love what he is doing or working in, as a result his motivation to work will increase, he will have more friends, his social life will be more interesting, so he will really enjoy his life. The individual's health will be improved when he feels good, enjoy his life, be satisfied of his life style.
