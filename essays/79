Summer vacation is considered to be the most exciting part of the whole school year.
As a teacher, I think that summer vacation should be long for both teachers and pupils.
As for teachers, 10 months of teaching and dealing with school and pupils issues is too much; because as we know teaching process is not that easy. So teachers need to take a long break in order to recover.
However, most parents find it too long because they work during the summer vacation and don't have a place where to keep their kids.
Therefore, they start to look for campuses and summer schools in order to spend time in them. This is one fo the summer vacation disadvantages.
