The age should not be a barrier to enjoy life, young or old, it does not matter. Everyone has their own way of enjoying life. Although young people have more energy and money to spend; yet they are usually short of time with their busy schedule of office, work, family and building their career. On the other hand, older people have less energy but they have a lot of time and life experiences that make them understand the value of even the simplest things in life.
Most of the older people prefer to spend their time on things which they enjoy. They utilize their time by spending it on the things they like; hobbies they were longing for since young age; spending time with their friends, family, and their grandchildren. While younger people prefer to spend time during job because they want to provide a good life for their family. Younger people take a lot of things for granted; and they do not stop and think about life that they are living rather they are busy working and building a bright future that consumes a lot of their energy and time.
Older people seem to enjoy simpler things more than young people do. Older people enjoy just sitting with their friends and having a cup of coffee. They just seem to appreciate being alive and being able to see the people they are. On the other hand, young people do not truly appreciate what they have till they experience some hardships in their lives.
To sum up, I really believe that the process of appreciating life and living an enjoyable life, unfortunately, comes at an old age. Because then people will understand that they do not have a lot of time to live, therefore, they try living each minute to the fullest. And they start appreciating every small detail in their life.
