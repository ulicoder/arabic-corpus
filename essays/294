Recent years, technology is a common way to use in classes, and education. But, there may be issues about using too much technology. Some schools are using tablet computers instead of using books in class.
When students use tablet computers instead of books, they don't learn according to Singer and Alexander (2016), they spend time on external things like texting or using social media websites. But, on the other hand, students enjoy lessons with using tablet computers.
On another study, it was shown that students using these tablets had an increase in their math test scores in one year compared to students using traditional textbooks.
So, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) actually agreed and support the idea that tablet computers help students.
But, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) study is only about math. What about other subjects? Results may be different when conducting a study in English lessons.
To conclude, using too much technology may be effective sometimes, but sometimes it may harm the students and not help them.
