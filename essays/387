In general the three articles were interesting to me especially because they are talking about something we use daily which is social media also I got a lot of new information by every article, but, the most interesting one to me was "Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is The New Summer Job", actually I found it interesting because its talking about teens who spend their summer days working in different jobs, while other teens earning money just by making some ads on Instagram, which does not take a lot of their day time.
The most researched and presenting the best evidence article to me was also the one that I found it interesting "Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is The New Summer Job", and that because it included people experiences.
