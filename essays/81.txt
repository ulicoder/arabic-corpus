In Israel teenagers are allowed to get a driving license at the age of 17. I don't agree with this because a teenager at this age is not matured and aware enough to the dangers that may happen while he/she drives.
Most teenagers can't wait until they get the driving license, they start driving fast without being aware that the street is not only for them. Therefore, I would prefer to start driving at the age of 19 or even 20. At this age a person would be more responsible, more mature and will be able to drive more carefully.
