Women are as capable as men in computer science and technology, but in general they think differently and have a tendency to avoid mistakes and maybe they feel frustrated when their code does not work.
In addition it is so important for women when selecting careers to know that more women are entering the same field.
The tech industry favors men and its resulting organizational culture is wittingly or unwittingly making that point very clear to any women who thing they might like to be a part of it.
