Humans usually want to show a certain view of their lives to others because this is part of our psychology. Therefore, many people today look forward to events because they know they are going to post photos afterward. These photos show others that a certain human lives in a specific lifestyle. As a result, followers can assume specific assumptions about him/her.
Furthermore, some posts of people show changes in their books because if someone tends to post picture of himself, s/he will start caring about the way s/he looks. Therefore some may start to feel unsatisfied about their way of looking or not liking their way of living because of following celebrities on Instagram (Dion, 2016).
Besides, another explanation to the ratio of posting posts on Instagram is related to the level or narcissism (Sheldon and Bryant, 2016). Therefore, it can be understood that someone who posts a lot on Instagram is someone who likes himself a lot.
