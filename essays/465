The good teacher no one forgets him / her because he teaches very well and give everything he has to benefits his/ her students and help him.
The good teacher must be a nice person and strong to control the class.
For me the good English teacher is my English teacher in the high school, I liked his way in teaching it was a serious and fun way, it's a good and kind person beside his strong personality.
The good teacher makes his students love him and like the lesson when he teach them and be happy when they learn with him, and he must stands beside them when they failed in the texts and give them the encouragement for standing up and be more excellent in the subject.
The good teacher must be objective and ask all the time if still a student not understand the lesson to repeat it to him and he must be patient.
Finally I want to be a good teacher that students not forget me, I will give all as I can to be benefit for them and help them in the teaching and in the life and I want to be an excellent teacher.
