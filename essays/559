A teacherâ€™s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Being a teacher is more than just teaching your students a pure information, you should also communicate with your students as a friend so they will love your subject more, and they will love to learn with you.
I agree with the quote which says that the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because when the teacher is only caring about the subject and teaching it, without caring about the students, they might won't be able to learn with him or they might won't like neither the teacher nor the subject he is teaching, so they will fail, and he wont get anything at the end.
there is some ways the teacher can make his relation with the students good, such as asking his students about their own life, he can play with them, telling stories about himself, so they can feel more comfortable, both the students and the teacher.
In my opinion, a good teacher should care about his students and he should talk to them about their own problems from a while to another, so the students will trust their teacher and they will have a good time while learning with him.
At conclusion, I would like to say that a good teacher is a teacher who can balance education and teaching with caring about his students, and he is a teacher who can save his students name.
