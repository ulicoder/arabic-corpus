First, teaching something important for all of us and we must work hard to make sure that we do the right thing take the right information by the right way in teaching from the right person.
No one forgets a good teacher like me when I was in high school there was an amazing English teacher, she make me love her class when I love the teacher I become love the subject that she learn it to us. There is saying: give a fish I eat for a day teach to fish I eat for a left time. And that what I want to do it with my student I will learn them how to love my class how to love English language without any fear they must feel comfort and tells me what the difficult they face it and they must work really hard to success in this major my teacher in high school was have all this adjective she good controlling , ethic, responsibility. I will never forget her because she is the reason to being me love this amazing language she was deal with every student fair way without forget anyone and still asking during the class "are you sure that understand" and "if anything is not clear raise your hand and say" donâ€™t be afraid. She makes me broke the wall of fear for sure I will never forget this brilliant teacher this teacher depend on many thing one of them and the important is to make sure that the student comfort and not afraid or face problem she was solve all my problem and tells me how to deal with my difficult in simply way without any complication.
In my opinion this is the reasons for being the student not forget a good teacher because the good teacher still in heart forever.
