Education in a single gender school could be very different, basically, men and woman in real life work together, they are exposed to each other in real world, they share many things as well. Teaching them in one gender school gives them an unreal perspective on work of the real world. Teaching them in such a kind of school makes them lose the opportunity of knowing how to treat the other gender and how they can be treated by their other side. I think that it is pretty good to have a sense of competition in the class, it is so useful and encourages students, from both genders to do their best, thus we can have a perfect learning environment in the classroom, and students get better results.
