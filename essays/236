Paper books were produced several years ago and people used them for multiple reasons. In contrast to the e-books where people didn't use them frequently. Therefore, in this essay I intend to talk about why paper books are better than e-books.
Paper books are greater than e-books because they are printed, and it's easier for people to ready them, because of the effortless visual access. Reading off screens needs more effort and so exhausting. It makes people feel uncomfortable while reading paper books is extremely convenient because we can control the books with our own hands. In this context, the study by Helm and his colleagues (2018) "participating US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided." Unfortunately, PWC Consulting (2019) found that in 2018, e-book sales were higher than print book sales in US and UK. That is surprising and shocking, because I expected to find the counteractive results, that the print books, undoubtedly might sale more. Teachers, parents, and students should become supporter to the paper books, because they are better for health and for the mentality.
