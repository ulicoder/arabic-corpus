Learning requires high concentration, therefore, the learning area and environment should be suitable and comfort for each student. There are several reasons that lead to lose concentration, one of them is the presence of boys and girls together in the same school. So, most of the girls schools became popular in recent years because when they separated between boys and girls, it cause an understanding of why we should separate between both. I reckon that if we separate the girls will be more concentrate on their study because they will not think about their love relationship with boys for example, and not one can deny that fact. Moreover, there will be no comparing between boys and girls, and here will be more spirit of competition between girls alone, and this will lead to better results, also girls can express themselves and their opinion comfortably if there were no boys.
In summary, I believe that separating between boys and girls in school will be better for both of them.Or there will be learning problems in school for boys and girls.
