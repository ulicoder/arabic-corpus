Spring is my favorite season. Actually, I like seeing my garden blooming. This scene makes me feel better when I stay at home.
Moreover, going outside in spring, when it is warm, makes me feel fresh and powerful. Indeed, I don't like summer and winter. Feeling hot or cold makes me feel bad. I think spring is the most appropriate season for outdoor activities. As a result, spring vacation is my favorite.
