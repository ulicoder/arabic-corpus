Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. The evaluation is very important for teachers and for school. In my opinion, I support this evaluation because as a teacher you can know the thoughts of your students about you. The teacher can know what are the weaks points of him/her, that the students can't say them for his/her teacher.
Schools have to know about their teachers from their students. The students have the right to evaluated their teachers because the students are the part of the lesson, I mean they involve in the lesson. By that way, both the teachers and the students will make a good successful environment at the school.
