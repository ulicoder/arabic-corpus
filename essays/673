This place "Mount Alsheikh" I visited one years ago, I went to there because I love this place because there is a lot of snow and ski playing, I and my family play with the snow and do ski in the snow. We do everything the human can do there.
We bought an ice cream from there before we leaving.
I feel excited because this place is the most place I go and be well in there.
