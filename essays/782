Some schools started using tablet computers instead of textbooks. These schools relies on technology and gives up using the old-fashioned teaching. According to a study by Mifflin Harcourt (2011) showed, that students who used iPads raised their math test scores 20% in one year compared to those who taught by old-fashioned teaching. This study showed the success of using the iPad in schools and their positive effect. Besides they help improving the students' results iPad tablets are also enjoyable and students like to use them.
Another study conducted by Singer and Alexander (2016) found that students enjoy using the iPad tablets but their high scores they get better when they learned using the print textbooks. This says that there still a positive effects of the old-fashioned teaching when we used it in a right way. We can use the technology to teach our lessons as teachers but we still need the books and the textbooks for best results.
In my opinion, I believe that technology is a device which can helps us in schools to make teaching more enjoyable and one of the new methods that we can use to make our class more fun, but absolutely not to replace the books and the textbooks.
We still need books to read and to have in our bags. Moreover, iPads are expensive that poor students can't buy.
