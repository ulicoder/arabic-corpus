In my perspective and according to my personal experience in the teaching field, the smaller school classes are the more efficient teaching is. Having small classes allows me as a teacher to be closer to my pupils and focus more on each one of them. It allows me to follow their educational process and give them the attention they need. This, the teaching process will get better and students themselves will enjoy their classes more.
From previous experience, students will feel relaxed to ask and participate more in the lesson. For me as a teacher, it also encourages me to be more active in classes and try to participate more pupils in the class.
