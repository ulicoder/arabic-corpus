On the last month, we have asked, if we suggest that fast food restaurants should be banned in the vicinity of schools. I have answered that I agree with suggestion for many reasons.
At the first, the all know what the negative things of the fast food. When the students eat the fast food, most the students lost their concentrating, and it makes the students feel ill, and it makes the students more fat and there many effective that I donâ€™t remember them.
At the last I advice to change the food in the vicinity of schools to be more healthy because we want the students be more concentrating and less fat.
