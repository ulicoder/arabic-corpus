The students spent time with their teachers more than spending time with parents and teachers are an important part of student's life, so teachers should know how to deal with pupils, how to understand them and how to guide them but, a teacher with no knowledge is not considered a successful teacher and children should go to school for learning and get educated.
Another words of describing that, a successful teacher is a teacher who relate well with his students and has the excellent knowledge.
All that I mentioned up is so important and real but in my personal opinion and personal experience I see that the teacher who know how to deal with students, I think that should considered as the best and most successful teacher .
As a teacher you should find a good language to connect with your students so they feel more comfortable , and this makes it easy for them to learn.
