My favorite season is the winter. I like the rainy and cold weather. It gave me the warming. I feel that I have a lot of energy, because my family sit with me. So, the family gave me this energy to be strong woman. Really, I prefer to be at home with my darling family. Preparing hot soup, rice with milk and hot drinks. The most interesting thing in winter season that we watch a family movie. I wish to live in winter season, it will be my sweet dream.
