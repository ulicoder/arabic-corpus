To begin with, I would like to point out that after reading the three articles on the Instagram influences, I  have found that all three of them are very interesting and that there are many things that can be learned from such as the most interesting one is: "Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job" in this article I have learned the that you can gain money by posting on Instagram and by having Instagram followers. I experienced an interesting and very enjoyable reading, which during the reading I felt full of things from my daily life.
The thing that interested me most in this article is that while people are going out to work full hours outside the house to make money, others easily get more money just by being famous and having full and full followers.
This article showed me the best evidence while it includes people personal experiences.
