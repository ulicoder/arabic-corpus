Personally, I agree that students should evaluate their teachers, for some reasons: first, evaluation of teachers will help teachers to improve their abilities and work on their teaching strategies. Also this evaluation will give the teachers the opportunity to understand some gaps that the students face during their lessons. Second, the evaluation of teachers makes them more responsible and carry out their job and performance.
Finally, the evaluation of teachers by students should be incorporated in schools as it helps teachers to improve their teaching and knowledge and make them more responsible.
