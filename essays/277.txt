This present paper discusses schools' later start time. Namely, starting the classes later than 8 am as usual in most schools.
Accordingly, some studies found that school students perform better when the classes start later. This is due to the fact that students can get more sleep in the morning, which can help them be more alert and energetic.
Moreover, starting the classes later might be also beneficial for the teachers as well. Hence, teachers can get students attention and better performance that on its turn will develop the learning process effectively.
However, some students and teachers have and opposite point of view. Thus, these group of people believe that students' performance is better at the earlier hours of the learning day which are mainly in the morning. Therefore, they claim that students' concentration is higher in the early morning hours such as 8 or 9 am than in the noon.
