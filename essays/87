There are different kids of points of view about the idea of integrating women in computing and tech fields. One point doesn't see women as enthusiastically as men. They are also not encouraged to do this field.
The other point is that it might be attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists. I am with the first point of view because women are not really given the right to pursue and work in this field. Society, school, and parents are all to blame. She's limited to work and to enter only certain fields in order to forbid her from improving her station in society, which is so frustrating.
A woman should be given only time and chance in order to survive and succeed in all fields.
