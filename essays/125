Personally, I don't have a favorite season. If I like a certain season that would depend on the experiences that I had during this season. For example, last summer we had a wonderful summer vacation in Eilat.That made me love the summer season. Before I had this vacation, I liked the winter season the most. Another example - I used to love the spring. After having my last spring vacation in Europe, I changed my mind completely. It was extremely cold. My family and I didn't have fun at all. As a result, spring has become my least favorite season. These days, I am enjoying winter nights. I spend a nice time with my husband at night. We sit together, we sit close, we eat. The whole atmosphere in the winter is warm and romantic.
Every season has its own characteristics, we make the difference our own experiences.
