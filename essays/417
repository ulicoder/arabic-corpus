These three articles discuss the new social media life, a lot of teenagers nowadays use Instagram and some of them became so popular that it affected their life and made it more difficult, while others actually could gain money from it by selling clothes and so. One of the article talks about a 13 years old girl who started selling trending clothes through Instagram and actually she gained money. In my opinion this way of getting money is really good, it's easy to use and people can gain a lot of money from it even though they're young.
