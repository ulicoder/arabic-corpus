There is a problem that women and girls are not pursuing careers in science fields.A research done by the National Center for Women and Information Technology shows that there is a decline in the number of women pursuing science field. According to Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV. I believe that there are many reasons of not going to science fields. First, women see few women go to science fields so they have few examples to follow. Second, parents do not encourage their daughters to go to science fields. Third, women have a lot of duties to do in their daily life and in life in general, so they can not pursue science field that needs a lot effort physically and cognitively.
To conclude, to minimize the gap gender in science field women need to be supported and encoraged by the society in general and by her family particularly.
