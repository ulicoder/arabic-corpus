I think school isnt only a place where children are educated. In addition of getting educated, they deal with different social skills. such as sharing, being independent and getting self-confident. Schools prepare a member in the socity. Those children will go to collage or workplace they will be surrounded by females and males, because of that I don't agree with single-sex school. It minimizes the communication skill with whole society. Females and males together force alot of communication problems and that raises the tension between them which leads to destroy the basics of the society.
