We choice (Amneh and I) to present the short story "The sound of thunder" by Ray Bradbury.
First, we decided to start and to read and read the whole story and then we expanded our reading to analysis and to summarize the story, it can help us to understand the story as much as possible.
At the beginning of the story, I thought that it is not an interesting story
Fundamentally there are events not very clear in the story.
As a result, I saw a movie about this story it makes the idea clear.
Moreover, we decide to make our presentation in a new program or way and not to use the PowerPoint app we used the Prezi app.
Actually, it takes a lot of time to put this information in the slides may I can say this is the difficult part so after that we collect all the information about the author, characters, events we present in front of the students.
Additionally, we apply what we learned when we read a story.
I think that this course helps us a lot when we start to read we enhance and rich our language in our thoughts also.
the most part that I like when I present a presentation the feedbacks it also says that we can always do the better and improve yourself and finally to work on it.
