Women and men have different levels in pursuing careers in computing and tech fields. Women aren't pursuing careers in computing and tech field like men do.
First of all, women are not encouraged enough by people around or the society to develop themselves and pursue careers as men do.
It may be due to the idea of women who should only work at the house, take care of their children and husbands. The analysts of the National Center for the Women and Information Technology claims that "the low numbers are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys".
Additionally, women don't have females role model. Dr. Cheryan argues that women don't have this opportunity for careers due the "the rise of pop culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows". I agree with him because actually, women are not going to be encouraged to develop and look for better careers in tech fields if they don't see lots of women who did that.
To conclude, I agree with both, the professor Cheryan and the analysts of NCWIT, that women aren't pursuing careers in computing and tech field like men do.
