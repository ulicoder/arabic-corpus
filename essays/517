Yes, I do agree with the statement above. Personally, I think young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people's passion and energy are enough to enjoy life more than older people do.
First of all, young people do not have much responsibility compared to older people. For example, older people have many responsibilities to take care of. For instance, take care of their children, to earn money, to complete their work, etc. These responsibilities limit them from enjoying their life.
Secondly, young people have more energy to do anything. In contrast, everyone knows as you grow older your energy somehow drains, and your body starts to get weaker by the time is passing, and in some cases you might suffer from some disabilities.
Thirdly and lastly, young people enjoy life more than older people because of how easily they can follow the technology compared to older people. And technology is one of the most joyful thing in our life, well at least to us young people.
For example, we use social media, many kinds of applications to be more connected to our friends and maybe families and even for things other than just to be connected with other people, like, looking for information, games, TV, music but I guess connection is the most important. So, more connection creates more close relationships, and more close relationships mean more enjoyable life. However, older people can only connect with their friends using traditional methods because the technology of today is more developed than how it was during their time, so they donâ€™t really know how use it like we do, and it is still kind of new to them. As a result, young people can enjoy life more than older people.
Eventually, I just want to say that us young people, well I am young, 20 years old and married with no major responsibilities yet, still have more time, unlike older people, more time to take chances, and try many things and make mistakes and learn from them. so yes, we do enjoy life more.
