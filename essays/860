Having two months as summer vacation is really a good idea for both students and parents. After a long hard school year that is full of homework and exams, it will be a chance for students to relax without annoying themselves with preparation for the next day or worrying about exams and grades. What is more, is that parents rest too from being worry about their children results at school.
Looking at this long time, we can find that students have many things to do. Some of them go to work in order to help their families in expenses or to save money. Others stay at home helping mothers specially girls , and there are also a number of them who travel abroad.
In addition, there are students that have different sport activities that enjoy doing in summer like surfing and swimming, because most of the school year is extended from fall to spring, which is a time that doesn't encourage like these sport activities. Furthermore parents who like to travel will be happy spending the time abroad with their children.
In conclusion, as a mother, spending two months with my children is a prize that I am happy to have after a hard-long school year.
