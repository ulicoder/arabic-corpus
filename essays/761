When I was 14 year, I went with my school to Jeep trip, this trip was a beautiful tour, we had a good and happy day with us.
When we were in the bus we have happy moments, we listen to music. we laughed so much and we cried from happiness.
The weather was so hot because we were in desert.
First of all we eat the lunch and was so fast and funny. This trip was a lovely trip in my life. We met boys in my age and become friends for them
and finally we back to home and feeling inside so happy and love.
