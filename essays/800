I think it all started with the "bow-wow theory" as it says its the first words in history such as "boom!" the sound of explosion , "splash" the sound of something that hit the water and so on and when humans heard these sounds they tried to mimic it and repeat it when they hear these sound until they are able to say these sounds until they became words and i think that from this theory humans were able to develop even more sounds such as "klank" the sound of metal which lead to screwing two pieces of metal we get the sound "vrrrr" and that lead that humans were able to develop their own langauge through out the history and i think that even this theory led to discovring the other theories such as the "pooh pooh theory" which describe the words we say when we show emotions such as pain we say "ouch" or when being angry we take strong breaths and so on which enhanced the language we speak in our days even more , so when the human started mimic the sounds in nature in ancient history and repeating it again and again he started developing his own language to be able to communicate with his groups and speicies so our modern language that we use today and speak and able to communicate with it with each other its all thanks to "bow-wow theory" and if we didn't mimic the sound according to the "bow-wow theory" we weren't be able to communicate or even understand each other in our modern day. And even led to the intraspecific communication which is the same species are able to talk and understand each other and communicate among each other.
