My favorite season is spring. In spring everything is new and beautiful coming to life after the winter and the cold. Flowers come out and the weather is so nice and warm.
I like nature and colors, in spring the flowers bloom it makes everything happier. In the spring all the birds come out as well and it is nice to wake up to the birds chirping.
Butterflie and bees begin flying around. In spring life comes back.
