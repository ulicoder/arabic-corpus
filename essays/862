The summer vacation is the time that every pupil longs for, and the end of the school year. After all, it is the time to relax after the final exams. However, the eight weeks that make up the summer vacation can have some disadvantages.
A long summer vacation can have a lot of advantages. In addition to the fact that pupils do not have to have homework, they get the chance to spend more quality time with friends and family. This time is usually free of tension related topics about their performance and their grades at school. Furthermore, it is the time of the year where pupils can have a get-away vacation, where they can be away, in a different environment having different enriching experiences.
Despite all these advantages, a long summer vacation can have enormous disadvantages. To start with, pupils can become bored and lose their organized daily routine. They stop waking up on time. Their days become nights and their nights become days. They can get involved in many bad habits such as spending their time playing computer games or watching TV series.
Having looked at both advantages and disadvantages of a long summer vacation, I tend to agree more to have a year-long school with short vacation. This way pupils can enjoy more vacations and stay focused at the same time.
