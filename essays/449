Firstly, I'm sure that all the professions contributes to the society in a different ways, but there is a profession that contributes to the society more than any other single profession.
So I think this profession is a teaching. We all respect the teachers and we as students learn from them and looking at them for advice and support to strive for greatness.
Teacher is a person that encourages and listens to his students. He not only teaches them but also shares them their problems and helps them to solve it.
I really appreciate this interesting profession, and I see teachers a patient persons.
And if we just thinking about the society and all the professions like doctor, nurse or any other profession we will realize that all these successes persons they are strive for these important level of education and learning by their teachers. Because of that we can't success and learn if there is no teachers.
Personally, I will not forget my teachers they teach me and told me about the stages of my development, they not only saw me grow but also helped me to grow.
Because of that, I chose to be a teacher and I am really working hard for that, because it deserve this studiously, I feel that this profession is too match to my character, a patient and influential person, I like to guide students and to be their Idol.
I think also to be a teacher, is very important to have the ability of influencing on others, in order to support them, a patient to answer their questions and to be active and a good person to guide them.
Teaching profession is not only a career but also a letter, you should teach it carefully.
