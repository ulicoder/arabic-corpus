A good teacher is caring.
Teaching is not about the money that you gain from the job but about the connection and the impact that you have on the students.
Every teacher should have the passion to teach and that passion can be seen by the way the teacher behave in front of her student. Sadly that is not what you see in most of the teachers so I want to give to my future student good education and a friend that they can open up to, I want to become a caring teacher because I think that what a good teacher is all about.
I want to set an example for my students, and I want to be someone that they look up to and that cannot be accomplished without caring for your students.
Some people might ask, what do you mean by caring? In cases like that my answer is simple because caring is all about being there for your student and make them feel closer to you, I promised myself that I will not be one of those teachers that can obviously see there is something wrong with their student and ignore it because it doesn't matter to them.
Being a teacher is a blessing because you know that you have an impact on the future generation and I want to enjoy it to the fullest.
