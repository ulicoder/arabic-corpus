With regard to Singer and Alexander's (2016) point of view, on one hand, students enjoy the use of tablets more than print textbooks, and students learn better when they use printed textbooks, on the other hand, a study by Houghton states that using iPads increased test scores. In my point of view, I totally agree with such views, for iPads and tablets have a major impacts in students creativity and some learn better when they use iPads, but not text books.
With regard to the former discourse, I back both of Singer and Houghton's perspectives regarding the benefits behind using iPads instead of textbooks in class, and the joy it brings to students while studying. For example, tablets are much lighter than textbooks, for it can contain hundreds and even thousands of textbooks. Besides, it is cheaper than printed textbooks, since students would have free online copies regarding different kind of topics.
In addition, tablets have a positive effect on saving the environment. This is seen in the amount of printings for instance. Furthermore, tablets contain many and wide technological features that cannot be found on written books, and help students prepare for a world immersed technology well.
In conclusion, as mentioned, I believe that, tablet computers and iPads should to somehow replace textbooks in schools.
