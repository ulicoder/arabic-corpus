Unfortunately our presentation (Donia and Yara) was short a little bit, so in the future we would include a long activity perhaps, or a video that clarify the story actions more or things like this, but its ok because we actually worked hard on preparing for the lesson and at the end of the lesson we can see that everything was very clear for the students, because when we asked them questions they participated and answered correctly.
I didn’t made grammatical mistakes, but the teacher told me that I did only one, and it was because of the circumstances and focusing on the material and not my speaking, so for me it’s a very encouraging thing that I would keep it in my teaching.
I learned a lot from this experience, because it’s my first time teaching students a literature story, I learned to be very confident while teaching, also to try as possible to let the students talk more than me and to make the class more energetic by adding extra activities to practice what I taught them.
Overall, I felt that the lesson went very well because Yara and I covered all the material about the story and we didn’t read from the presentation, so it was only a key for us to remember things, and not to use it as a teacher who contains the whole knowledge about the story and we are only readers.
I felt that I was very confident and comfortable with the students so they express the same feeling. In the next lessons I will organize the time of my lesson well, and I will make it longer.
