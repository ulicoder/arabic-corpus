I agree that young people enjoy life more than older, this is due to many reasons.
Firstly, older people passed all the negative experience on their life when they were younger and still effect on them during their life which makes them unhappy for example: someone who lose his brother he will always remember this unhappy moment.
Secondly the activity that was enjoyable for them they can't do it anymore because they lose their fitness this activity was enjoyable form them for example: playing sport, and other activity that must have body effort. In addition, people face the age of senate which mean they lose their motivation to the life and start to feel more desperation which prevent them to enjoying in the rest of their life span they feel that their life not useful anymore and this stage takes many years from their life they face many difficult in order to passed this level which takes more and more years from there life. I think the age senate the most important reason for being older people did not enjoy in their life because this age have a large negative effect on them and there are many research had agreed on this. Which makes me more convinced in my opinion. for example, the women when they become older they think that they lost their beauty which lead them to feel less confidence when they meet people which increase the desperation average I think this is the reasons for being young people enjoy in their life more than older people.
