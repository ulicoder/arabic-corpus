I heard about the term "clean eating" before I read the three articles. However, I couldn't understand it clearly.
I don't believe in doing diet, so I wasn't really interested in these articles. I believe that it's not really matter if you are obese or thin. The most important thing is to eat healthy.
And this is the clean eating. It is eating the things that the body needs. You can't prevent your body of a thing. If it is healthy or not. But, you should make sure that you don't eat a lot of it.
The first article: "why we fell for clean eating"? talks about.
This article talks about a girl who is a  fitness model who was suffering from a serious eating disorder: orthorexia, she used a diet in the dangerous way without realizing it. She had problems with her diet. This article is trying to tell us that if we do something we think it would make us feel perfect by doing it in the perfect way. It may be harmful for our health and in this way we would cause our body health damages.
The second article "too clean" talks about if we change our food, that thing would be harmful for our body. If we follow an eating system, and suddenly we change it, it would be harmful for us.
The third article: "Clean eating goals you should know" talks about ways we should follow to improve our kind of food.
I don't agree or disagree this phenomenon, but everyone have  to follow his own suitable system.
