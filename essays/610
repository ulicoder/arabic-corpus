For my presentation I choose the story "Hills Like White Elephants", this story attracted me from its title, I was very curious about the story and very enthusiastic to know what will happen next, and through presenting the story I felt at first very nervous because I have prepared it alone.
For the next time I have a lot of things that to improve; first I need to make my voice higher than this that everyone can hear me, in addition, I need to work on my grammar through my speaking and use the appropriate tense.
For later times, when I present this story once more I would like to ask the students at the beginning about the symbols of the white elephants and what they think they indicate than to tell them the true answer.
