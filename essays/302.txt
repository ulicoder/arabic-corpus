Tablet computers are a new alternative for textbooks nowadays. Students prefer to learn with them, which makes them more interactive in the lessons, and therefore they show better results in school achievements. However, some students may learn better when they use print textbooks, because tablet computers might grab their attention to the extent that they do not focus on the material itself.
Although Harcourt (2011) argues that students had better scores in math when they learned with iPads, this might not be applicable in all the school subjects. Some subjects are better learned with print textbooks.
As Singer and Alexander (2016) discuss, using tablets is more enjoyable for students, but they learn better with print textbooks.
