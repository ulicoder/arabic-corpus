In my opinion, single-sex schools are not a good idea, because we are equal in our community. We have the right to learn together, both girls and boys. There are many benefits to be mixed in the school. First, you can live with the other equally. Second, mixed schools give the chance to deal / treat with pupils as a boy and a girl, I mean that there are activities in the school for girls and boys together. So, the girls can participate the boy's activity and the boy's also can participate the girls activity. The mixed school improved the education of both boys and girls because they learn from each other. It affects the community between both genders. I think the single-sex schools don't prepare them for life where men and women have to work together.
