According to Dion (2016), "people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started experiencing a decline in life satisfaction". People are putting so much energy into the way they depict their lives on social media in order to them to have a life that is similar to the celebrities. Still, they mostly are unable to reach this, and it causes a decline in their life satisfaction.
There are some people who look forward to events to take and to post afterwards their pictures in that events. In my opinion, giving this amount of attention and making effort is totally unaccepted, since we need to see self-satisfaction from ourselves not from others and their opinions towards us.
