A good teacher is organized.
To being a teacher is beautiful if you like this job you will teach it to the students in perfectly way , and to know how to make a difference in there's future, teacher is not a job also it a vocation you should to know how to talk with your students, how to teach them and how to make them understand your teaching.
You should to be always organized with your students to come in the right time and to teach them in the right way. If you want your students to understand what you mean in the class first you should to understand them, if they make a mistake speak with them in beautiful and carefully way and tell them that's not a good doing you should to be quiet and focus with what I said in the class to be a smart one and to get a high marker.
I like to be an English teacher especially to teach children because I love kids so much, and first of all I love this subject and I love the joy of making the differences of the students future and to be more stronger in English language, this language spoken all over the world so, its good to learn it for travel and if you love to listening to English songs or to read books to can to understand it and to make a foreigners friends.
