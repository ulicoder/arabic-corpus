Nowadays technology is replacing everything around us, it is replacing books, papers and even pens but it can't replace the fact that we need them in many situation.
Schools for example should always use textbook and not technology like tablet computers. According to Singer and Alexander (2016) "school students enjoyed using tablet more than print books but learned better when they used print textbooks". Although student enjoy using technology but yet it harms them. Students should take a break from using technology because once they get back home parents will let them use it and specially tablets. One the contrary to the fact that tablets are enjoyable and textbooks are more useful, a study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) found that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to the students using traditional textbooks.
In conclusion, tablets can be used in classrooms but not replace textbooks, if a study proved that students will benefit in math if they use tablets, then schools should take the chance to allow tablets in match class only, this way will be a mixed variety to the learner that like technology and that prefer textbooks.
