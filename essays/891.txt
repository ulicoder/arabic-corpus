Pupils deal with various teachers on a daily basis and they get to know their teachers very well. I think that the idea of evaluation teachers by their students is very good, because both teachers and pupils will benefit from it.
This kind of evaluation will give the teachers the opportunity to know how well and clear they convey the material to their students. If they get high marks from their pupils then they know that they are performing as teachers in a good way. This thing can be very rewarding for the teachers and it will definitely give them a push to even do better in order to keep up with their good work.
On the other hand, sometimes the pupils' evaluation may not be credible for many reasons. Pupils might not take this evaluation seriously or they might dislike some teachers and might want to have a revenge. And thus we cannot always be sure of how credible the evaluation is.
To sum up, I believe that evaluating teachers can bring many advantages to the school system but it has to be done in a way that can guarantee honest results.
