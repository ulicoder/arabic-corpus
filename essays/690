In my life, I have a one goal; this goal is to buy a horse.
When I was young, I loved the horses very much, when I see a horse I immediately think of riding it, because that is the most important thing for me.
If I want to achieve my goal, I will need to work in the near summer vacation in order to earn money because I donâ€™t want anyoneto help me because it is my goal. Meanwhile, I am not wasting money I am saving money in order to pursue my dream.
