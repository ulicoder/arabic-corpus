Last holiday my parents planned us special trip to Batumi, Georgia, so on 8th of April we packed our luggage and went to the airport. Then we board the plane and took our seats… So here we are taking off.
After 4 hours of flying we arrived to Batumi's airport, we took a bus to get to the hotel…
We had special time and we enjoyed it because of the natural views there.
We visited many great waterfalls.
