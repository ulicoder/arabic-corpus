Some people believe that single-sex schools are a good idea. This preference is based on the fact that girls are competed or intimidated by boys. Boys tend to harass girls whether physically, sexually or verbally.
In my opinion, boys aren't born this way but rather they were raised in a way that causes them to misbehave with girls. Therefore, the solution should be different. In other words, people should think of changing their way of treating girls rather than isolating them in single-sex schools.
Regardless the fact that there should be a change in how girls should be treated, isolating girls in single-sex schools is not helpful to construct a healthy society. When the two sexes are separated, they would fear the other sex existence or essence. Therefore, it's preferable to have both sexes in one mixed class or school, because in this way there won't be a barrier between both of them, they would feel normal in front of each other, explore themselves, and feeling as united rather considering themselves as enemies.
In the end, human nature consists of two main sexes that they need to live in this world or cosmos together and shouldn't fear each other but rather building a society that accepts and encourages both of them.
