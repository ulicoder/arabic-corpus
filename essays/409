Actually, the three articles were interesting, but the most article I did really enjoyed and make me be more passion in how can I get and earn money from the social media apps! This was for me a new idea I didn't know about  before, to be honest; , is "posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job", and  it shows the reality indeed, while someone famous can earn a lot of money because he/she has a hundred of followers on Instagram  contrast to someone who works in the summer and study at the same time.
