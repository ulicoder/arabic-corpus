First of all, I was not satisfied about how I did present the presentation because there were some mistakes that I did not pay attention for it, but in the other had I felt that the structure of the presentation was so good, according to the time that the presentation take was maybe 20 minutes to finish it.
I did not talk about the pregnant woman or that she was pregnant I did mention the operation but not the kind of it, in this case I think that I should talk about it because it is an important point to mention. also, I was a little uncomfortable during the presentation, I think that I have to walk into the class more between the students.
Maybe I can also add on the activity that I did a question that would make the student think in a creative way
Like, to ask them to tell me or to guess what would have happened on the end of the story "Does the girl do the operation or not and why", but also I think that "Kahoot" website was a good choice.
There was another thing that I want to mention that there were some mistake's grammar mistakes on the presentation that I did not pay attention for it, I felt like there is some mistakes during the performance, when I was presenting
I think that I should go over all the presentation before I presenting it again and again to make sure that everything is written right, and correct all the mistake's.
There was a spelling mistakes during the presentation, like the world Barcelona I did not say it in a right way.
I have not practice at the spelling of the words at all that something very important also that I have to pay attention for it in the next time.
