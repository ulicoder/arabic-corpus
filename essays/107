There is a boy called Mohammed. He is a very cute boy. I explain anything in my class, he being to said: "like me" and start to talk about his family without stopping. Really, he bothers me. One time I explain my lesson about the present simple tense, and I asked the pupils what do they do every day. Some of pupils raise their hands and I give someone to talk. When he/she begun to talk, Mohammed stand up and said, teacher "like me". Really, I hate this word "like me".
