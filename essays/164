Summer vacation is the longest vacation because it comes after almost ten months of teaching and learning. As a teacher, I think that summer vacation is not long because according to psychology it is difficult to teach a long period without breaks.
Teachers in schools nowadays are not just teaching, they are also raising the pupils, especially pupils who have many problems in their families. So, they have to rest.
In addition, as a mother for less than five years old children I need to play, raise and enjoy my time with my children so the summer vacation gives us the opportunity to live a clam life with our children without pressure.
To sum it up, summer vacation is a very nice period that we can spend it with our families.
