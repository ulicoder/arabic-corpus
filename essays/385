First I want to mention that I've read about "clean eating" before, when I was on diet (actually I'm not anymore) and I'm one of the people that are always interested about it so I have a lot information that I've seen it when I've read the three articles.
Nowadays, we can see that clean eating phenomenon is not common, I said that because I see that the new generation especially are not taking care of what they eat, if it was healthy and clear or not, I think that they need more information about clean eating so they can follow the advices and to have a healthy life style, and of course they should follow it in a right way in order to affect on them positively.
By reading the three articles, I saw that each one of them is presenting clean eating in a different way, some are showing us the negative side as Susie Burrell said in her article Too clean? Potential dietary deficiencies of clean eating, "But when this concept turns to banning all sugars... nutrition starts to be negatively impacted", and the others is showing the positive side of it, but the most article that had my attention and persuade me to follow it point of view the one that titled "12 Clean Eating Goals You Should know", and the goal that I've liked the most is goal number '7', "Try More Spices" they mentioned canned and dried food, actually I'm one of the people who love to add these two next their my meals.
From myÂ  point of view we actually need to eat clean, our body needs, but when you decide to eat clean you should know that you have to work hard on it, I think it's not an easy thing to do, you need to follow steps to do it in a right way so it will be useful for you.
