Instagram is one of the most known applications that is used in the world. This app became so popular in the last years. People from all ages are becoming obsessed with it, and they cannot live without it anymore, it's a part of their lives. Instagram like any other app it has advantages and disadvantages at the same time. Many researches have been done on the people that use it, checking the effects of it. In this paper, I intend to talk and to discuss the effects of Instagram on our daily lives.
According to Sheldon and Bryant (2016), that "the amount of time people spend editing photos for Instagram was significantly correlated with the level of narcissism", this is not necessarily accurate, there might be some type of narcissism that was raised because of using Instagram but generally speaking, most of the people in the world use this application, just for fun, and for sharing memories, and experiences, and not for the off. Usually, the narcissism is part of the celebrities where they are selfish and love to show only themselves.
Moreover, Instagram is a fun app and I recommend using it, but at the same time it's not good for health, because of the amount of time spent on it.
