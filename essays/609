It was two weeks ago, Aleen and I started to prepare for our presentation.
The first step that we did is that we started looking for a story from the suggestion list that the teacher gave us, for each story we use the internet to have a little information or a summary about it in order to choose one. Then we chose "The Story of an Hour" each one of us printed it and read it by herself at home. The day after, we met at college and we discussed the story (the characters, eventsâ€¦) and if we feel that it fits our thoughts and if we will feel comfortable and confident in presenting it.
After this part, we started working together step by step on the presentation and everything we did was accepted by both of us, and also understood. We worked hard and prepared well and this was shown in our presentation today and also the good reflection that we took from the teacher proves that we were prepared, although I had grammatical mistakes and Aleen tried to correct me. It was helpful to have a collaboration between us in order to help each other when is needed, and also to encourage me to keep trying until I get it correctly and this made me feel how strong we were together in front of the class.
This experience makes me able to accept others' thoughts and that working together is beneficial for us.
Finally, for the future I will try to be relaxed as much as I can in front of the class in order to make the information that I convey be received in a successful way.
