Single-sex schools have some advantages and good effects on students with different genders but also, have some disadvantages on the students and their personality.
When students are in a single-sex school, they feel less pressure because they won't compete with others from the same gender. When they don't have to compete, it may affect their studying and it may cause to less academic achievements because in their class or school they don't have the spirit of competition, specially for the boys.
Although, single-sex schools' students can concentrate more on their studies. When students are from the same gender, they won't have things to distract them.
But, this may affect these students and affect their personalities in the future. Students spend most of their time at school. If they are all from the same gender, when they finish school and go to the real world, they would face many problems to deal with the other gender.
They would have problems to build relationships with the other gender.
So, to conclude, single-sex schools have advantages, but they also have bad effects in the real world, after school.
