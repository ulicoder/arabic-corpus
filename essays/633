First of all, I was very glad that I stand in front the students and presented the story the "The Lottery", it was a good feeling.
I spent two weeks to prepare this presentation and to choose this story and me and Yasmin cooperate to choose this story, then we start to discuss the story and organized the material and there was an effective Participation and we were a great team work. When I start to present in front the class I was nervous because this was a first time I stand in front the class and discuss and analysis a story, and when I finished presenting I learned it is necessary to prepare well before the presentation, because students and also the lecturer can find out if you are not well prepared. I have also learned what to think about when you're preparing for a presentation, I felt a bit nervous and because of that I lost focus and this makes me stop thinking about what I'm doing, and so I start talking faster than I do. So, I learned that I should concentrate a lot on trying to speak slower and this is the first step that I should do better also to focus on the grammar when pronouncing. in my opinion the content and the structure of the presentation was good.
I know there are some things that I can improve, but I am proud of all that, I think I should prepare myself more than I did this time and practice more.
