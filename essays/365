The three articles are talking about Instagram and how it's affecting teenagers, the articles  also presenting the  Instagram as a job for teenagers but actually I really against this phenomenon because teenagers should live their life simple and normal they don't need to be popular or I think it is a big responsibility for teenagers because they already have to concentrate on things like school which is more important than being popular and one of the inane celebrities how wasting their time doing silly and stupid things just to gain money and Increases the number of followers.
one of the best articles for me is Posting Instagram Sponsored Content Is the New Summer Job because, thank god, this article presents an advantage for this phenomenon and it has the best evidence because it's present numbers which are a piece of evidence that support the author opinion.
