Life in general is to be enjoyed, even though life as it is could have ups and downs to it but still, it always reminds us of how beautiful it is, we can see the beauty of life in every small detail that exists, for instance flowers, animals, family, countries, languages, love, god, music, food and many other things, those things can be enjoyed both by elderly people and young people. Also, age does not define the amount of fun a person can have according to their age, it is rather something to be cherished by everyone. Life is beautiful and everyone should be able to embrace its beauty, being eighty years old does not mean that a person cannot enjoy life, therefore I disagree with the statement above, enjoying life is just as equal.
In the Arab community, we as Arabs might look at it differently, when we look at elderly people in our community we can see that they basically enjoy doing nothing, they only sit at home complain about their sicknesses and boredom and how life is being so rough on them instead of embracing the fact that they actually got the chance to live in such a beautiful world, instead of appreciating every moment they had with their families, and that is rather sad, because it's not that they do not have the opportunity to enjoy life it is actually the exact opposite from that, they seem to enjoy complaining about how difficult life is instead of enjoying it. I could really relate to this in an example: me and my sister have a hobby where we love to go to the cinema, we love watching movies in general, every time we go I get the chance to see and elderly person with her or his granddaughter and then I turn to my sister and say I wish grandma would come, then we laugh it over because it just sounds funny to imagine grandma at the cinema with us and if we come to think about it that is really wrong.
People in Europe for a change are rather different than the people of our community, speaking out of a personal experience, elderly people actually seem enjoy more than younger people and that is because of the free time they have, unlike younger people who must have studies to do or work or any of the other life charts that is to be done. This also happens here in our country, if you look at the Jewish community they also are very different from us, when they grow older they seem to enjoy life even better, even in the most simple things that we could think of, like riding a bus for example I dream of seeing my grandma or grandpa in a bus, sounds rather funny, but yes! Why not?
Enjoying life does not depend on our age, a person can be one hundred years old and still enjoy life more than a younger person, life is beautiful in all ways and it is available to all, so let's enjoy.
