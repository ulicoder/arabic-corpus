Some teachers and parens believe that a long summer vacation is good and helpful for students, where they have to rest and enjoy themselves during this period of time in particular. As a teacher, I believe that the long-stretch of summer vacation has a major advantage on students. This is especially referred to several reasons.
Students will have the opportunity to spend much more time with their parents and families. In addition, they might have and enriching experiences during the vacation. For example, traveling with their parents to museums, new places, where they can learn and acquire new things.
Furthermore, students would not go to school during the hottest months of the year and stay at home. I also have to take into account that high school students would, actually, have the chance to work and get paid during this time. Besides, as adults, they will get more time to themselves. For elementary school students, a long summer vacation would reunite the family after a busy school year, and kids would have the experience of playing outdoor, where they might learn new skills as a result of playing with other kids of their age. Moving on to the impact that a long summer vacation has on education, students need to learn and practice essential skills in order to succeed in school and daily lives. Thus, an extended vacation is very essential to students, where they can learn productivity, and responsibility for instance.
Overall, I believe that the long stretch of summer vacation is very essential for each student. As mentioned, students might benefit from the summer vacation in many different realms.
