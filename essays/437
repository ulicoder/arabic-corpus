A filter bubble refers to the  results of the algorithms that dictate what  we encounter, those algorithms create a unique world of information for each of us, many sites like Google Facebook offer personlized content selections based on our browsing history, age, location and other data. The result is articles and posts which support our current prespectives and this is their way to make sure that we enjoy what we see, in my opinion this is a bad thing because  my social circle is a filter bubble, I only follow people thinks like me and have the same opinion and perspectives that I have and  forget that other people perspectives exists causing me to become intellectually isolated.
