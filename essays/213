It is well known that temperature is an important factor for people's productivity. In other words, people are behaving and thinking in a better way with certain temperature degrees. Nowadays, we are using air conditions to control the temperature of the place that we exist in, like home, office, supermarket and so on.
In summer, we usually suffer from high temperature degrees, therefore, we use air conditions to create a colder surrounding for ourselves in order for us to feel better and to function better.
According to Murphy (2015), being able to make people feel cold in the summer is sign of power and prestige .This point is true, so we can feel, in which we view places and institutions with air conditions with higher value than those that are not provided with air conditions because this invention shows development so it is an advantage.
On the other hand, there are some studies that argues that we should not feel cold in order for us to function and to achieve better. Hedge and Gaygen (2010) claim that optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that. Therefore, we can conclude that the use of air conditions in summer is good and beneficial, but we shouldn't overuse it.
