My favorite season is summer. I really enjoy the hot weather because it is the perfect atmosphere for doing outdoor activities. I believe that there is nothing more relaxing than spending some time under the sun. In addition, the school's vacation is in the summer. Thus, I have more time to spend doing things which I love, such as, traveling, swimming, and reading.
