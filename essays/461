We all know that teaching is one of the hardest subjects, because teachers must work hard to illuminate all of the students, they must inspire them, teaching them how to believe in themselves, and eventually to dream big, and with a great job comes great responsibility. That’s why it is a profession that creates all of the other professions, because teachers teach all kind of subjects: science, math, languages etc. And because of that teachers have to lead these students so that they could find the right way to achieve their goals.
Teachers should be supportive, they should believe that every person is capable of winning and being successful, and that’s why they are not supposed to underestimate anyone's ability.
A simple example how teaching create a profession is that the science teacher should teach his students science in an attractive way so that they could fall in love with it which means that they start actually asking questions, dig deeply, think more and more about that subject, and eventually that child will grow up being interested in physics, medicine, laboratory, whatsoever.
And that’s why I believe that teaching is one of the most important profession in the world, because in not just about teaching 1+1=2, or being strict at everything, it's about getting all of the information in the world and recreating it to a phenomenal subjects that could be learned with joy, excitement, passion, so that the kids of today could choose which profession they want with the help and support of their teachers.
