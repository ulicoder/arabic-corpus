We as parents wait for the summer vacation especially for whom have kids. We don't have to worry about exams, quizzes or studying process. There is no studying. It is less pressure for all, parents and kids. In addition, summer vacation presents a great chance to go a long trip with the family; last year we went to Germany for two weeks forgetting all the worries about everything. As a teacher, summer vacation gives me the opportunity to relax and read some novels that I can't read in the rest of the year. The only disadvantage is getting back into the normal routine in the end of the vacation.
