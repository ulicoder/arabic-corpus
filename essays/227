Computer science degrees were always gained more by males than females. However, it was found by the National Center for Women and Information Technology that during the 80s women earned more computer science degrees than today. Some researchers suggested that the decreasing number is due to not encouraging girls enough to study this topic. Further, other researchers suggest that it is due to the representation of computer science students in TV shows, music videos and movies.
In my opinion, I think that the reason of this phenomena is that girls are not exposed to computers, technology and video games as boys are. Boys from a young age grow an interest in technology that girls rarely do, and I believe it is due to the little representation girls have in technology and pop-culture in general. If there was a larger representation of female figures that study computer science in pop-culture, then young girls might get influence and maybe in the future they are more likely to pursue a career in computer science.
In conclusion, I believe that the two reasons stated in the presented studies are linked since that one study affect the other. The more girls are well-represented in the computer science field, the more they get influenced and encouraged by themselves and the surrounding.
