One day, I and my friends go to see festival in Netherlands. When we arrived, we see that the electricity cut off. One of them say: "we want one of you to help us". We could help her because we work in electricity, then we go to help her and fix problem in the festival. She telled us "Thanks to you I'm being happy". In the end, he thank us and was the most beautiful day.
