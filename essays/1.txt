Some parents and educators feel that two months is too long a break from school. I don't agree with them, because during the school year, and, especially, when parents are educated and working, we don't have the opportunity to sit and chat with out kids and that leads to a strong gap between us (parents and kids), we start to lose this connections and that sometimes leads our kids to behave in an aggressive way.
Besides when we as parents are working, we do not have enough time to go out with our kids and have fun and build up together this strong relationship, so in the two months vacation I can make up to satisfy my kids about the time we lost or were not together.
