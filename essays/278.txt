Many studies conducted recently about phone calls and texting. For instance, the study that was produced by O2 company which show that 75% of Millennials prefer texting to calling.
According RIT researchers, this results due to the fact that participants do not like the small talk and the need for an immediate reply. Therefore, actual phone calls became the fifth most used apps among the general public.
In this regard, if I personally compare the results to my personal habits, then it show the opposite. In other words, I personally prefer usually to call the person who I need, it save a lot of time waiting his response by messages.
Moreover, making phone calls allow people to communicate better, since that usually texts do not show or reflect our real feelings, which is considered to be one of texting disadvantages.
However, based on the studies that have been done about this topic, phone call made will be less than now.
Especially that many people prefer using texting rather than making phone calls in order to not annoy the person who they wanted to communicate with.
