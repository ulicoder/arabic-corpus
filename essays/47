The size of the class is very important. As a teacher, who works in two different schools and experience the difference between teaching small and large classes, I am convinced that teaching small classes is better for both the teachers and students.
Working with small classes has many benefits. It gives the teacher enough time to pay attention to all his students needs. The class is also quieter therefore, less time is spent on the classes management. Moreover, within small groups the students are more likely to ask questions regarding the things that they don't understand.
To sum up, I believe that all schools should divide their classes to small groups. This way the learning process will be much more meaningful and effective.
