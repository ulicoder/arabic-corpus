One of the prominent technological innovations is the “filter bubble“ introduced to the world of the internet in 2010 by activities Eli Pariser. This technology has a great impact on the user of Internet that strategically aims controlling his thought and from broad exposure to information that may contradict their point of view  on any social, political or any other issue.
Throw this innovation, use of algorithms performed to assume information that the user many like to read or be exposed to. This assumption of information is based on the location of the user, issue that he or she in interested in, political attitudes, food, arts, social issues, etc...
The user social and internets background are examined and searched in order to finally reach the information that may please him or her.
Such innovation is in my opinion, destructive  rather than helpful for several reasons – First, the intended users are deprive of the freedom to be exposed to a wide range of  information in different issue which many block his or her image of thinking and limit their ability to express rationally and objectively on different kinds of situations.
Secondly, the user may be stuck in misjudgment attitudes towards crucial issues like presidential elections or opinions on lows or social phone mane.
Thirdly, filter bubble may personation information and after relatively long time, the users may find themselves trapped in a biased attitude and find difficulty interacting with the surrounding people and change opinion or attitude.
This innovation may serve the interests of the political elite or the leading business rather than contribute to the interest of the individual as a person who can contribute to the change of the common guard of humanity with their diverse and rich information.
