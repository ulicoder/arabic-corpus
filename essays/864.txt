Approaching the twentieth century, researchshows that the number of females who pursue careers in computing and tech fields is dropping. According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, the number of women who earned a computer degree dropped from 37% to 18% in 2010.
The decline of women who enter the scientific field is due to the fact, women are not encouraged to choose science as a career as men because it is a field that is a sterotype for makes and not females. According to Dr. Cheryan we also witness this sterotype in media where males play the role of scientists in different television shows.
Another factor is based on the fact that that scientists are the nerds of school and often they are not attractive and socially isolated by students. Thus, females do not want to be in this position where they do not have the chance to be attractive and well-known at school.
In my opinion, women should be encouraged to intgrate into the field of computing and hi-tech because it is the future. Women could find alot of jobs at this field which is available for them, to be creative. They could succeed at this field as other field, where women showed their best and were successful.
