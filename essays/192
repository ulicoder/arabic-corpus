Learning includes many fields and subfield, therefore, we can choose the topic that we are inspired by. Usually males are attracting to specific topics and fields such as: science, math and computing, unlike females who are attracting to topics like: literature, teaching, make-up and so on. According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, in 2010, women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in US, down from 37% in 1985. Moreover, analysts say the low number are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys. Another reason may be because of the influence of TV shows that give the idea of scientists are always makes and that according to Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, theorizes that this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows like "Revenge of the Nerds" and "The Big Bang Theory". I reckon that most of the above is true, no one can deny the fact that society can affect us, our choices and almost everything and when the society is always deciding the role for males and females it will lead us to the point that we may follow what is the society is ordering us to do, so parents, teachers and society in general do not encourage girls to enter these fields even.
