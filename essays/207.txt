Feeling cold in the middle of summer is a case that many people suffer because they overuse air conditioning.
People may feel cold in the middle of summer in places such as stores, offices, classrooms, or even their own home. Some stores overuse air conditioning and make people feel cold to show their power and prestige such as luxury stores. As Murphy (2015) claims "being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores."
However, making people feel cold and overuse air conditioning lead to less productivity. Places that maintain cold temperatures may affect the concentration and people's work. As Hedge and Gaygen (2010) claim "that optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less productive and make more mistakes in the room temperature is lower than that". Thus, this might affect the students' attention and might be less productive.
To sum up, people should balance the temperature and they should not overuse air conditioning since it leads people to be less productive and make more mistakes.
