According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, the number of women who gained computer science degrees have been decreased in the last years.
The issues of this decrease has been studied by some researchers to find out the factors that affect the number of women who are involved in computer science. Dr. Cheryan for example, claims that this decline refers to the pop-culture portrayals and the TV shows who present the scientists in a certain way that doesn't usually change, which is a white or Asian male.
Therefore, science started to be more common among males. Women gradually started to be marginalized in this field, since we have never seen a woman play a computer scientist role in a TV show, so it seems to be a position that is only for men.
In fact, I do agree with the theory of Dr. Cheryan, because TV shows do affect us and the way we think.
On the other hand, I do believe that the family play a main role in this issue, they can motivate their daughters to be involved in sciences, so they can have stronger effect that TV shows.
