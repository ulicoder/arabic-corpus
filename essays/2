We as teachers try as much as we can to avoid saying few words in class, like: sex. Me personally and especially in our society it's very hard for me to teach these words in class, because our kids are not ready yet to hear them; our traditions and norms force us to avoid or ignoring saying them because they are not accepted in my society or the community we live in.
I think when we teach new (bad) words we must take into consideration some important elements:
First: do my students expect to see me saying these words?
Second: Are these words used in my community?
Third: is it necessary to teach that word? Or is this word a main - key word in a text or not?
Fourth: it depends on the age of my students.
Finally I think we must be careful when we teach words that we do not like because sometimes it might be embarrassing.
