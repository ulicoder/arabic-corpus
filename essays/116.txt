Extending the school year through July, with two or four week breaks in August, or to have a long school year with short vacations is a not a good idea for me.
As a teacher, having a short vacation is not enough for me. Students and teachers need break to rest, have some fun, and go abroad.
Most of the families argue that it would be better to have short vacation because it is kind of hard for them to take care of the children or to stay at home with them, specially if they are not teachers and have work in July and August.
