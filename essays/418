The "filter bubble" is a system on the internet the based on our research  on the internet, for example when we search on the internet on topic, google will not give us the topic in general that it will give us the specific points I am searching for this phenomena's is dangerous and we need to be aware of because google will show us specific  information, that we are searching for and makes us pleasant and more popular. However, it hides from us information, because this system is invisible, we can't find it we won't know what had been hidden from us.
In my opinion, the online search and the news services should provide the exact information to their customers in a decent and honorable way. They shouldn't exploit their personal information for making money. I believe that it is frustrating when social media sites show me the most popular posts instead of my family posts, because I'm interested in what my family want to share me more than any other posts even if they are popular, because there is no financial greed behind their posts.
