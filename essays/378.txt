The filter bubble...
Never heard about it!
Unless you read about it you will never understand that this is what is happening with each one of us.
Actually during my reading I logged in to my facebook account and a shopping add appeared I looked at the clothes and shopped online.
What I did not notice Is that they took all my information and even my credit card without any afford which is something that I'm going to think twice before sharing it my in real life.
I continued with reading and I realized that there is a plan for everything this add didnâ€™t came out from nowhere, no someone knew what is my type what I exactly like and what I want.whenever we search for something whether on Google or Facebook Netflix Snapcat Instagram we spread our personal information for free ,and we have two sides for this story.
The good side is that we can see what we really like and the kind of things that we are interested in.
On the other side a lot of personal stuff is out there and I'm sorry but anyone can acsess it wether by stealing the information or stealing our heads by butting some adds that would lead us to buy things that we don't even need.
So be carful.
