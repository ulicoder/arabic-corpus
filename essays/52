Children who use to watch a lot of television misunderstand the meaning of the bad language. Subtitles could be misleading, for instant, they give different translations for the "f" words with another interpretations such as, I wish you to lose. In my position as educator, I advise them not to use words from another culture without being aware of their meanings and if it is acceptable to use them in our society or not.
