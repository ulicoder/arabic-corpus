Students start their studying at school by the age of 7 till the age of 18. They study several materials and spend most of their time studying and preparing for them. In Israel, students learn every day from 8:00 to 3:00, which is 7 hours daily. Pupils come back home tired and exhausted. They eat, have some rest, take a shower and start doing their homework assignments. They finish in the evening. Did they play? Did they have free time? Of course no!
Personally I am against giving homework assignments to the students, because in Israel, we have the "long teaching day", and students have a short time after school to play and do what they like.
As a mom I also feel pity with my son, because he spends long time doing homework assignments after a long school day.
Homework assignments are a waste of time and effort and they are unuseful according to the last research findings.
So please, stop giving homework assignments and give a chance to our kids to live!
