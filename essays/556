A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I do agree with the statement above, a teacher’s ability to relate well with students is the most important thing in order to become a bitter teacher because being able to communicate with student can lead to a much comfier and understanding environment.
Excellent knowledge of the subject doesn’t necessarily mean that the teacher is capable to deliver the material well, knowing the material is never enough because you can't always pass the material to your student, also too much information might make things complicated for students, students don’t need to have excellent knowledge of the subject, understanding the subject without going into details might help them better and they well see the subject as simple as the way it has been delivered.
A good teacher doesn't mean a teacher who knows everything about everything, a good teacher is able to deliver and communicate with his student, a teacher who give enough information to his students without complicating them.
Relating to the students is a must for better communication, unless the teacher wants to get over with his job by delivering the material and that’s it.
But it's not wrong to have an excellent knowledge of the subject but as long you are also able to deliver it in a good way that match the thinking and the ability of students, if the teacher is working with high intelligent students it better to treat them differently and according to what they are able to receive from the information.
The key to a better teacher is to communicate relate with the students, if there is no communication then there will be no understanding and if the students didn’t understand the material then the teacher fail in his job of delivering information.
