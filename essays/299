There was found in research that women or girls are getting less computer science degrees than they got in the past. Different perspectives were raised towards this issue. Some might argue that the reason for this is the lack of encouragement the society offers of girls for learn computing subjects. While others might discuss that this issue is natural, and they do not see any problem with since these subjects are more of boys or men interests.
I think that it is true that girls do not have much interests regarding computing subjects or fields, but still the reason out of this is the society. Girls or women, somehow, want to please their society, parents, teachers. SO, when they feel that the society doesn't think this is a topic suitable for girls, this is a reason for them why not to have enthusiasm towards it.
