When I finished my studies for the Bachlor degree, I never thought that I will be go through this experience again. I thought that it was enough. As a teacher today, I understand the importance of studying and developing. For me having a Master degree is about proving to my self that I am above average. I am astrong woman that can wear many hats as she wants and succeed. Having a busy life as I do, with work, kids and husbend, I tend to forget about the things that I could benifit from. These studies is my way to take care of my self away from everything that keeps me from growing.
My goals were always to have an easy and quite life and now I feel that I need more from life and maybe this could open doors fro me. I expect these coming two years to be challenging but I hope it will be interesting. I hope I would be able to become a better teacher and a better version of my self by doing this. I hope that this will make me stronger to overcome the obstacles in life.
