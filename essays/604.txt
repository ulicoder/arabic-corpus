The process of finding out the story till presenting it in front of the class was full of mixed emotions. Both of us, Hadeel and I, had other responsibilities and I was hard to start working on the PowerPoint a few weeks before the presentation but we made sure to take turns in looking for a story; I found one but a few days later we changed it. A week before the presentation, we sat down together to look up some stories and make a final decision. When we read the summary of “The Story of an Hour”, we both fell for it and quickly decided to start working on it. We spent a whole week working on it and making final touches, we had to go to college in our vacation days so we can finish everything without waiting until the last moment.
The process of making the PowerPoint was tiring because we had to wake up early or find some free time in order to finish it but we made sure to help each other and take decisions together; we never had arguments throughout the preparing.
The presentation went well even though we had some mistakes in it. I was a little surprised by some mistakes we made since we practiced and barely made mistakes but I guess nervousness took over us at some point. For example: when I corrected my partner’s grammatical mistakes.
Throughout the presentation, I felt that the class was paying attention and were interested in the topic and I saw that they were intrigued with it by the added visual clues; they even told us that they found the visual clues very alluring.
While presenting, I felt connected to the story and I tried to explain it as much as possible. I thought the activity that we started with was really helpful to start our story with and the one that we finished with made everyone feel refreshed.
I think that I need to work with the stage fright for future presentations along with any partner I have.
