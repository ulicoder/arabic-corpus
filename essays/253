Single-sex schools are not a very good idea although many schools follow this kind of style. Such schools can prevent girls and boys learn from each other and also working together and uniting together.
Learning with a mixed classroom many student interact differently. Having girls and boys in the classrooms will teach them to love each other and bring the harmony in families and friends. In a young age, children usually explore their self and the things around them. Putting them in a place where they see only the same gender can hinder their exploration when growing.
Having one gender in the class is not very good for education because children will not be exposed to the opposite gender at a young age puts them in a confusing place when they enter adulthood.
When student are only exposed to the same gender this may have a positive effect to it that children may feel comfortable to interact with the same gender. However when they do meet a person from the other gender they are unable to interact with them as if they are a different human being. This will lead to having poor communications in the future.
Moreover, children when they reach their adolescence and they are surrounded with the same gender it may lead to loving the same gender rather than learning to love different sex. By the time they reach their adulthood they might have a difficulty interacting with the different gender and this may lead o unable to start a family in the future.
In conclusion, having a single-sex schools may have a positive effect that is children may get better grades because they are focusing only on studies, but on the contrary it will affect children's adulthood in the future.
