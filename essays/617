My presentation is about the story “The Ones Who Walked Away From Omelas” the title is a bit long but it is a meaningful short story. I prepared this presentation with my partner Aseel William Abdallah in four days and we did a very good job although we were limited in time we got a good feedback from Ms. Jumana and I hope we get a high grade too. At the beginning we presented the events the description the figures of speech the characters and a short video then we did an activity with the themes in order to make sure that they got the main idea of the story and we finished with the last activity, we asked students to draw a cover for the book. This is the first time I work on literature presentation actually I don’t love literature but this presentation gave me the push to start think about dealing with literature, because I am a creative person who love to think out of the box and literature is something like this, when you prepare a presentation especially literature presentation you have to be creative in order to let the audience enjoy and feel the story in addition I was afraid of the idea of teaching literature even short stories but while preparing and doing this presentation I realized that teaching literature is much more fun than anything else and as a teacher I can use creativity while teaching literature.
Prepare presentation for teaching a short story needs much more time than four days we tried very hard to make our presentation look good even perfectas well we didn’t get sleep for 24 hour in order to prepare a good presentation.
