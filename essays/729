I would like to describe a person she did for me a nice thing, she is a great person in my life. My best friend was with me the last summer of 2015 in Barcelona. on the first day in Barcelona, I visited with her many places and spent many money, on second day I want to go to the stadium.But not had money in order to pay the ticket, she bought the ticket for me I was cheerful because I can get this ticket. I want to be a good person like my best friend and I want to help her when she needs.
