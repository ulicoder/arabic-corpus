Some believes that a separate gender schools are very essential, for gaining knowledge and popularity for both girls and boys, while other believe that a mixed school gender is, to somehow, not important for both girls and boys.
Regarding my point of view, I do believe that having a mixed school gender is, actually, very important for several reasons. Firstly, being in a mixed gender school would, to some extent, make both genders compete with each others. They could learn better, since they might have the ability to be exposed to different ways of thinking, for boys and girls do not share the same interests and thoughts.
Secondly, since boys do not share the same interests as girls do; for example, a different studied discipline would be asked in the same class, so both genders can have the opportunity to share knowledge regarding different issues learnt within classroom.
To sum up, I do, indeed, back the idea of having a mixed-school gender, for underling the fact that girls and boys are, actually, very equal.
