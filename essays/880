Instagram, in my opinion is one of the most popular ways people use to communicate with others on social media.
I hear people around me talk about Instagram and that it is when you take pictures of yourself or with friends and post them so that people who use Instagram see your pictures. I think it is too much when you picture yourself every day and every minute and post the picture on Instagram. That is to say they is no privacy now a day in the world. People can know where you are and what you do and that is not a positive thing in my opinion. Some people spend a big amount of time posting photos on Instagram due to the fact that they love their selves and how they look, this is correlated with their level of narcissism (Sheldon and Bryant, 2016).
I think, that these people with something not good. Celebrities have a big amount of people who follow them on Instagram, when these people see the celebrities lives how good it is, the fun they have, they may feel unsatisfied and hate their own life (Dion 2016).
To conclude, when people decrease their using of Instagram, they may have time to see their friends in real life and have a better life.
