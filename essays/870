I agree with the idea: teachers should be evaluated by their students. As a teacher, I always ask my students to write their feedbacks down and evaluate me. This is referred to many reasons.
Firstly, the main reason why teachers should be evaluated by their students, is because it is them who have the opportunity to see their teacher's performance within the classroom. Students, as well, spend most of the time listening and learning, so a feedback could be helpful for some teachers. For example, teachers might improve their teaching skills and materials regarding such feedbacks.
Secondly, another reason why should teachers be evaluated by their own students, is to give their teachers the chance to become better in their jobs. For instance, it could give them the chance to have a reflective education process and enjoyable one.
In addition, a feedback could be good for students too. Thus, students would feel more engaged in their learning process and they might feel that their opinion is necessary either.
Finally, as mentioned, both teachers and students could benefit from giving feedbacks. Teachers can identify their strengths and weaknesses, while students can enhance their learning process and become engaged.
