In recent years all-girls school have been gaining popularity due to the belief that the girls learn better when they aren't competing with or intimidated by boys, who statistically get more attention in the classroom, single-sex schools are a good idea. Single-sex schools is characterized by its benefit to both genders girls and boys. Teachers in single-sex schools can adjust the teaching methods to the students. For instance, boys often need a higher level activity than girls need.
Therefore, in the single-sex school there are teachers who are well-training to be teachers at boys' and girls' single-sex. Such schools usually boys and girls feel more comfortable, the girls in particular, sometimes they feel uncomfortable to speak loudly, because they think "what if my answer wasn't true or my question was silly, my classmates would laugh at me". Those girls are very shy, especially when there are boys in the classroom this will made them to be intimidated from boys' claims which maybe will lead to bullying by the boys.
If the girls and the boys were split each gender at different class, this will make the girls feel more confident in themselves and they will have the courage to ask about anything they feel that it's not understandable, and this will affect their outcome at the end of the year, to have a high grades. To conclude, separate schools or single-sex schools are a good idea, to have peaceful environment in both schools gender, less problems that may have in coed schools, each gender will be more comfortable and have enough courage to ask and say whatever they feel it's needed to say / share.
