Some studies found that school students perform better when the classes start later. In my opinion, it is better to start classes early as usual. if students start school late, they will be lazy, they will sleep late and wake up late. Consequently, they will finish schools late. Most of their time will be consumed negatively and in a passive way. productivity will be affected negatively if this reform will one day take place. Students as well as teachers will get used to this new life style, that will affect their regular life style. They will have to come back home late, they spend more time in school. Let's not forget that school is not everything in life, people have other important priorities. They will have to learn how to organize these priorities well and everything will be alright.
