While most students enjoy the long summer vacation, parents on the other hand have an opposing view. They believe that the summer vacation should be shorten.
The most significant aspect of having parents demanding for shorter summer month vacation is that they have to leave their children for long hours at home alone, or they need to find a substitute to look after them. Looking at this view, parents are right for their demanding whereas children need their time off from schools, without homework and getting up early almost everyday. We should alo take into account the drawbacks that children have if they shorten the summer vacation, they won't enjoy the long summer months to rest, travel and have a quality family time.
Even though that is true for parents to be less stressed if the summer vacation will be shorten but children will suffer. I think that this is a negative idea because after months of working even teachers as we need their time off to relax and come back with more energy to give better at schools.
