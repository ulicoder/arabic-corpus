Fast food restaurants got spread in every place these days, like in cinemas, malls, universities and in every public place even in schools. but now it has been suggested to ban it in the vicinity of schools.
I totally agree with this suggestion because fast food restaurants have many disadvantages. First of all, junk food affects badly on students, because after eating unhealthy food, it becomes hard to concentrate very well. Second of all, fast food causes too many kind of ailments because of the big amount of fat that every meal includes.
At the end I think that abandoning fast food restaurants from the vicinity of schools can cause many positive results, so the students can eat healthier food and to become more healthy which makes them able to focus all the time and during the lessons without being disturbed.
