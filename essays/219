The topic is very interesting to me, the authors discuss the topic of computer science and why the women and girls aren't pursuing careers. In my opinion most of the girls today learn the same topics such as: teachers, and accountant. The parents most of the time encourage their girls to learn easy something because they keep saying "you will become a mother and have to take a huge responsibility so choose an easy topic and learn it." The parents in many cases support their girls to do many things but when it come to the topic of education, they support her less than expected. Moreover the culture effects the way how the girls think a lot, that the parents inherits many beliefs from their parents and this beliefs effects directly about the percentage of the women who learned computer science. So if those girls are given enough support definitely they can achieve many success in computer science the parents should start to give up about their beliefs and the inheriting somethings and give their girls energy and make them believe in themselves in this way I think the rate of the women who learned computer science will raise.
