Many research show that woman in world tech field droped in 1985 show that woman that were interested in computer careers are 37% but in years later show that it increase to 18% because many girls are not encourage to pursue science as often as boys.
In my opinion that when parents reject of sending their daughters to these fields, beside of this they are thinking that girls are not qualified to deal with tech careers.
In addition in the second research show that women are not qualified to show in movies and TV shows. These two research support each other that both show that girls are not allowed to enter in tech world.
In my opinion that this reseach is support the sociaty that many parents tech their sons how to use the computer and how to deal with it but for their daughter that not always allowed to do that.
In my experiance in my first year in the univerisyt, I asked my father to let me enter to learn sceince tech in the unversity, but my father reject it by telling me that you are girl and it not suitable for girls.
To conclude, relating to my experiance, women should envolve in these fields, especially if they have passion towere them. They may be extremly creative and do their best. Collaborating with men would create a challenge and togother they will achieve better result at work.
