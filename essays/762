Fast food is a big problem in all the world, all of us eat fast food at least one time in the week but not all of us know that it is not healthy for us.
I want to talk about myself. I am a student in the high school and there are some people who say that they want to end fast food in the schools.
I especially say that this is a good thing and I am with them. There are many things that made me say this. one of the reasons is that fast food isnâ€™t healthy and not good for the all second reason is, fast food cost money, and not all the parents have money to give to their children to buy fast food.
Another reason that, food from the home is cheaper and healthier from fast food.
In the end i want to say "no" for fast food.
