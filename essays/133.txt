In Israel, the law allows people to get a driver's license at the age of seventeen and a half. In my opinion, this is the perfect age because people are more likely to do what's forbidden especially teenagers. They may drive even without a driver's license and without learning the driving. That's why I think allowing people to drive in a young age and before 18 is a good idea. Indeed, once they get 18, they usually need a car for going to work. Not having a driver's license shouldn't be a limit for fulfilling themselves and going out to work.
