From my point of view, I believe that essentially single gender schools, particularly for girls, are a solid example of how female majority schools can be successful and well managed without any male presence. Male presence in classrooms were found to get more attention in the classroom due to their social competitions to become the rulers or main character of the class. Although girls have many common issues to argue about or compete, they would find it easier to focus on the process of learning and becoming more successful when they are learning in an institution that lacks the presence of males. I believe that in this case girls will have more educational opportunities to pose for their own opinions and thoughts. Furthermore, the nature of female behaviour among the presence of male subjects is frequently different in the same situation than another that lacks it. In my opinion, girls tend to be less concerned to impress others in the way they look or sound than a situation where there is male presence. They would be more focused on the main issues of the principal subject.
