I think summer vacation should be long for some reasons: summer vacation comes after school, tests and projects. So I think summer vacation is the time for students and teachers to take a long break, far away from stress and worries.
During the summer vacation, students and teachers will have the opportunity to sleep and practice many activities and even they will have time to develop their skills and what they like far away from schools, tests and homework.
