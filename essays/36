According to the researchers, women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in U.S., down from 37% in 1985. Analysts say that the low numbers are partly because girls' parents don't encourage them to study computer science comparing with boys' parents.
In my opinion, the computing and tech fields are as suitable for girls as men. The issue is in our beliefs. We needs to start the change. Moreover, our society needs to break the cycle because girls and women should participate in shaping their future in computer science since it's a wide field and always open to give chances of work.
