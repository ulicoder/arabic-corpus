The school has decided to ban the fast food restaurants, actually I agree with this suggestion because in my opinion there are a very dangerous disadvantages. When the fast food restaurants are in the school, the students will eat fast food everyday, so that will cause for them a lot of healthy problems, and many heart attacks, in addition this will cause for them fatness also many oils in their body, that maybe will cause for them heart attacks.
I donâ€™t see any advantages for fast food, the students able to get their food from the home it's will be better and more healthy, and this is a very better alternative. Also the fast food is more costly we can save the money when we get homemade food at the school.
