Instagram is one of the most recent social media platforms, where users can share photos and their daily lives activities, it is available as an app or as a website.
Generally, social media has made an enormous impact on people, specifically Instagram.
The impact of Instagram was studied by Sheldon and Bryant (2016) found that the amount of time spend editing photos for Instagram was significantly correlated with the level of narcissism. Another study was conducted by Dion (2016) found that people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started experiencing a decline in life satisfaction. I agree with Dion, because Instagram raised the point of having a negative impact on its users' mental health, and self-image. Because trying to imitate celebrities' life is not legitimate and realistic and it may have a bad result in your life.
