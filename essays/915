During my teaching process as a teacher, completing my master's degree was a goal that I wanted to reach and fulfil, I could say that I am a kind of teacher that is always open to encountering different approaches and accepting new information, because I believe that what I gain will obviously count for the benefit of my teaching style and method.
So the main goal of entering the MA program is to acquire new strategies and information in which I could integrate into my classes. Another important fact is my self-esteem, I always have high expectations of myself and I do know that if you set a goal you could achieve it and the MA degree has been a dream that has been postponed a several of times, if it was due to my children's birth, priorities in the family and of course financial issues.
Lastly, I hope that this dream will be achieved with the expectations that I have setted for myself and the grades that I wish to acquire. I do believe that it is about who you are, personality and priorities that gives you the choice of going on with your education or not.
