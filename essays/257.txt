The invention of cellphone was first intended for making phone calls later on it developed and was called a smartphone. It is called a smartphone for a reason and that is it can do more than what is was invented to do in the first place. A smartphone can be used for texting, taking pictures and even giving directions..
A recent study showed that telephone apps on smartphones which means making an actual phone call, are only the fifth-most-used app among the general public.
Due to the fact that 75% of Millennials prefer texting to calling, participants do not like the small talk and the need for an immediate reply. Furthermore when it come to teenagers they prefer texting rather than taking the time to call someone.
Another point of views is that it depends of the person that I am trying to reach, if it is a person that I am closed to then I personally might make a called, on the contrary if it is someone that I only need to tell them something or get information from them I prefer texting.
Communicating over social media has become the most way used even between families. This fact is coming to harm the community and the future. A life with no communication is like a life with no water.
Communicating with people face-to-face is a healthy process. Looking at our life in the future, cellphones will be taking over our brain and life. I do agree that it is hard to live with no phones but on the contrary people need to give their self more time for themselves to read a book or just sit and look at nature.
To sum up, if people to have that enough awareness it will harm the future of our kids and the ability to be better.
