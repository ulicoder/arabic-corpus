In one day, last year the teacher come to class and said to us that school will take us a trip on the zoo. In this day when arriving to the zoo. I know and saw many animals, that I am so excited to see it. For example, elephant, giraffe and lion. This trip was one of my best events in my life. I enjoyed in this trip and I will never forget it.
