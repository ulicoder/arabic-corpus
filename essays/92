Driving is always a fun experience as we get older. It gives us more freedom and it allows us to feel in control.
Personally I think that a 16 years old teenager is too young for the responsibility that comes with driving a car. Teen drivers are at greater risk of serious crashes than experienced drivers. In addition I think that teens with a car may cut their classes to go joyriding with their friends, this will influence them in a bad way. Therefore, I believe that they should not be allowed to drive until the age of 18 so they will be more responsible on the roads.
