Good teachers know how to bring out the best in students.
You know how angels be, how sweet theirs hearts and souls, how much mercy they have, I think teachers are just like angels, good-hearted with so much mercy.
Being a teacher not easy at all, it’s not easy to be patient all the time, with students or with the problems they made, but she have to, she must be patient. When a teacher stands in the class teaching and giving all what she have, cares for her students and gives the maximum, in that way she gives her students the inspiration to study, to work hard to do their homework with love.
When the exams are closer, she stands with them not leaves them alone, asking them what they didn’t understand and if they want her to repeat any class or any subject, in that way students will always being in her class, loves to hear her explain and teach, loves to study for her exams.
Good teachers are good not just with teaching, but also with dealing with her students in many ways, just like when there's a student in her class always making troubles and bothers her, would she just calling his parents and telling them that your child is a troubles maker and he deserve a punishment? Of course no! Good teacher will be with so much mercy, with a white sweet heart, she will call him rather talking with him, why you make troubles, what things you do not love at my class, what things you do not understand. In that way she can be closer to her students.
In the end, I believe in angels as much as I believe in teachers, and I believe that teachers can be so powerful that she can makes her students love and respect her in many ways that I have mentioned above, and she can bring out the best in her students by believing in them, in their abilities and in their cans, I believe good teacher know to change the can't into cans.
