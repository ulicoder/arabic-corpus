Summer vacation is not as long as some parents think. I think that pupils go to school just because, they look forward to the summer vacation. It gives them a push to continue schooling. Childhood's best memories for me were in holidays; I spent more time with family, pets, and friends.
Kids need more time to discover and learn about the environment and nature around them by themselves without the need of interferences of teachers. They also need to develop their social skills, in order to communicate with different people in different ages. They need to employ their learning knowledge in life.
