Nowadays air conditioning is an essential tool in our lives, it's well known that in summer days people seek places that contain air conditioning, and some of them even refuse to sit with their family, friends, and colleagues if not in a place that offers this luxurious device. Air conditioning is beneficial and important, in this essay I intend to address two studies that support the credibility of this claim.
Luxury stores know the importance and influence of air conditioning during summer that's why they maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores, which indicates power and prestige. As Murphy (2015) writes that "being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige" Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores." This power can be the cause for encouraging larger numbers of customers to enter the store.
Low temperature causes less productivity and more mistakes, which stresses on the importance of air conditioning, but also on having an optimum temperature.
To conclude both of these studies support the importance of air conditioning, one discusses the prestige and power air conditioning gives, while the second shows the negative effects of not having air conditioning or having low temperature on performance and productivity.
