The teacher must have so much appellate because she is one that student look at and the see themselves on her but for me the most important thing for the teacher and for the student is to be patient because the will consider to be kind caring wisdom and inspirational
The teacher is the key to have I succeed students, I believe that the teacher is the one that will make the student decided to love this subject or not to become a teacher you should be patient
Patient how to deal with the student
Patient because sometime you will have bad day but you should be patient and try to control yourself so that will not effect on the student
Patient because sometime you will listen to lies and harmful thing from student but you should understand them in addition there time will came that you will explain the thing so many time sometime not because the don not understand what you say but because the was playing around or not listing to you but the teacher should be patient in fact all of us was like that so carless
At last that the subject that you love and carry about and the most importin thing that the subject that you love to teach so if you want to became a good teacher you must have patient
And you should smile always even when you felling sad
Patient is not a simple word when a student came to you because the are depressed our have a difficult time you should be patient and clamed down to know how to deal with him
On other word patient meaning have faith on other and in yourself and believe that there nothing you can not deal with or felling helpless as long as you patient so you can thinking straight.
