No one can ignore the fact that single-sex schools are becoming controversial issues, and this has advantages and disadvantages.
Starting with the advantages, single-sex school could be a good idea, for instance, girls can confidently raise their hands and participate, without being made fun of, in addition we may stop marriage at a young age and dating. Moreover we may prevent sexual behaviors.
Moving to the disadvantages, it will be a lack of communication with the opposite gender. In addition students actually spend their most of time in school environment. So, by separating the school to single-sex schools, means to separate them from the real world where makes and females (women and men) coexist. So, it could be a struggle for them to communicate and interact with each other in the real world.
In my opinion, I prefer mixed-gender schools, because it gives the students the chance to meet and interact with the opposite gender, in addition schools play an important role, and I think schools are the play where the person grows and develops emotionally. so by being with opposite gender gives them the chance to be normal people, and ready to live in the real world.
