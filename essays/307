Single-sex schools might be considered a good idea for some people. Due to the fact, that there are many religious parent who prefer for their girls to be in touch with the other sex. This is because, the mixed schools offer the students of both sex the opportunity to communicate with one another. In addition, it might affect the girls' emotions as well disturb their track in their lessons, since might begin to try to arouse the others' gender attention.
However, there are other people who think about this case differently. Since, this is the way the universe was made and rather than separating boys from girls they prefer to integrate both sex together in one school. This action might encourage the students to develop their social abilities and offer then an environment in which they deal with one another appropriately and build a better confidence towards themselves and towards the other sex as well.
In my opinion, both sex school can offer the students more options. These options could be more important to develop a better generation and change it to the best. The community should raise the students to realize the differences of one another and accept it. In addition, students are not only supposed to learn material in schools, the schools should encourage the students to experience different situations and teach them to think out of the box and know how to act accordingly.
To sum up, single schools could harm the students rather than to benefit them. Moreover, I consider the separated schools as a main reason to the students isolation and being raised without knowing how to deal with bot sex in the future.
