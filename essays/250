Schools are the core of the educations system, probably the most important stage in students lives. Schools play a basic role in shaping our identity, self-esteem, social interaction, and the friendships we make or maintain for a lifetime. Single-sex schools can never be a good idea although it might cause some advantages in individual's achievements, this opinion is based on several causes and the purpose of this paper is to illustrate some of these causes/aspects. The social perspective and interaction, schools are the source for most of our social interactions, imagine a girl or a boy that almost never spoke to one of the other sex: how hard, strange, and embarrassing it would be to contact with one of them for the first time in periods such as college / adolescence.
Academic competition, it might be true that girls learn better when they are not competing with boys, the question is: does this belief includes all girls or only those who are poor learners or the other way around? Another question related to this belief is: does this belief depends on elementary school girls, high school, or both?
Most competitions between boys and girls result in positive effects for both sides, it is really not a good idea to prevent and take that away from them.
To conclude single-sex schools might have some learning advantages, but is's definitely not beneficial for students social relationships and connections on the big term.
