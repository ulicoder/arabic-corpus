School is a main source that help students shape his or her personality. It effects students' ability to engage in society. And it can offer an environment which consider a small sample of real life. Therefore single-sex school doesn't offer such a realistic environment to its students.
Single-sex schools do not gave students the opportunity to engage with the other sex which is something they will face outside the school.
In addition, the competition between boys and girls is a phenomenon that happens usually even at home between brothers and sisters and it is usually consider a motivation girls to do better. Therefore dual-sex school motivate. The atmosphere the single-sex school give does include a competition or interact between two genders which might effect student outside the school. For example, a girl who learned in a single-sex school won't be able to engage and handle the reality that boys are given more attention than girls or boys or men personality which can be intimidated by.
So, dual-sex school offers more realistic environment than single-sex school.
