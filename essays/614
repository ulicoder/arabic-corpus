On Sunday 13/05/2018 Saja and I presented about "The Necklace" story by Guy De Maupassant.
We searched and wrote the presentation very carefully, we didnâ€™t want to add extra information and then it will be too much and not relating to the lecturer's instruction, on the other hand we tried as much as possible to provide the suitable information and cover the basic and important things of the story.
I started to talk about the title and how it is related to the story, I felt that the students were concentrating and interested in the story's events (the climax, the characters etc..).
I believe that I achieved my goals in this presentation I explained the material as much as possible, almost everything related to the story was mentioned in our presentation, in addition we organized our presentation according to the lecturer's instructions.
To conclude our presentation we made an activity with the students, the activity was to retell the story by imagining different events than the real events in the story, when we finished our presentation and the activity I noticed how the students' facial expressions were, they were smiling and they were clapping for us and for our performance, I can consider our presentation a really good one according to the students' reactions.
However we had some grammar and pronunciation mistakes.
I hope that you really liked our presentation (structure, organization, content,the activity etc.).
