Interesting story that I was supposed to present it in the class,
As I chose this story I thought well, okay it's going to be as normal and natural as our regular stories, and that has made all the difference this story was something else, it contained so much more than any other story that I can think of, it took me to a whole other place and I really enjoyed it, and during the work I learned a lot of things, not just how to present things in front of the class but also knowing things about our real life and even facing situations that is similar to those that I faced in the story, something else that took my attention was how I'm supposed to think during this and I found that sometimes you need to take your mind and the ideas in it to a different level of thinking and this is something that I didnâ€™t do before because true I've had many presentations to present but to be honest this is the first time that I had to use my imagination and to think out of the box to achieve what I need and to show the others how I got here with this imagination, all in all this is the kind of presentations that every student need.
Why?
Simply it opens your eyes for things that maybe some other courses do not contain, or let's say other courses won't ask from you to use what you have inside your heart but what inside your head and this is what we did in this presentation, I followed my hear if it's right to say that.
