From my own perspective, single-sex schools are a good idea. First, statistically, girls learn better when they aren't competing with or intimidated by boys. It means that girls feel more comfort learning along and it mirrors on their results.
Secondly, when girls are learning with boys, they will put big effort on their appearance instead of focusing on the learning process. They will be more focused on the way they look, the way they speak and the way they behave and let learning behind.
Girls and boys on their early age like to be noticed. They draw more attention on the way other sex looks and thinks about them, especially in teenaged stage. Teenagers in particular are misled by their emotions, they are easily infected by the opinions of others sex on them.
Instinctively, boys try to show off their power in front of girls, to send them message that they in control. The strong dominate the weak by his muscles to show his empower and to tell that he deserves to get a relationship with a girl. This struggle will increase tension that run the education environment.
