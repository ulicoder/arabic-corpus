A recent study says that all-girls schools have been gaining popularity in recent years because of the belief that girls learn better when they aren't competing with or intimidated by boys, who statistically get more attention in the classroom. Personally, I don't agree with the statement mentioned above, I don't think that single-sex schools are a good idea at all because of the following reasons:
First, it is not a natural environment. Males and females are raised together in the family as brothers and sisters and relatives. We have to live together and learn how to deal with each other because family is a reflection of life. In other words, if we let our girls to study in a single-sex school, they will probably have problems dealing with boys in the community. They will definitely lack essential social skills in dealing with boys and the public in general. These girls might also have problems with their future partners, their colleagues and their bosses. Due to all these reasons, I do not recommend studying in a single-sex school
Second, I believe that parents bust believe in equality as a principle and deliver it to their children. Boys are equal to girls and that must be reflected in all aspects of life including education. If we separate girls in a single-sex school in order to protect them, we actually make them vulnerable. In addition, their personality might be affected negatively as a result of this separation.
To sum up, I want to say that I do not support the idea of single-sex schools and will not be happy to live in a community that supports this kind of system.
