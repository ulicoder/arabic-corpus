Women don't pursue careers in computing and tech fields. I think several reasons are responsible for such an issue. One of them is that we are living in a patriarchal society that starts from the first day of any female life to dress the baby girl with pink whereas boys are dressed with blue. Let's not forget that in certain societies or some families ask about the sex of the embryo the first thing that they know that a women is pregnant, they wait enthusiastically and wish that the gender of it will be a male. Such a dream of having a baby boy is associated to the fact that boys will carry the name of the family because girls aren't the chosen ones for carrying the family name. Such a way of thinking is detrimental to the developing of the society. Therefore, if the existence of a girl isn't that wanted, it's expected that women won't be welcomed that easily in many fields of work (or work fields - I have an issue with when to use "of" and when not in inanimate nouns).
Usually women are expected to be at home nurturing their babies and raising up their children, so how about seeing them in computing and tech careers, they are considered less intelligent than men.
Two studies have shown that the reasons for why women don't pursue computing careers can be partly attributed to the rise of pop culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows (Dr. Cheryan). Another study shows that women aren't encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys (National Center for Women and Information Technology).
