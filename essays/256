Schools around the world usually start early around 8 in the morning. This is because usually the brain functions better early in the morning but also the brain can function even better when students have the right exercise. Schools should start around 10 in the morning.
Children need enough sleep for their brain to function and be active. When children have enough sleep they will be more alert and awake in class and more likely to get better grades. When children get up so early in the morning with less sleep they are too tired to participate in class.
Having technology in children's life will make them not fall asleep at the right time but rather really late and this can be a major effect on children's activeness.
At the end it's the individual's choice of when it is better to start school but the time of school start has already made and maybe it would be changing.
