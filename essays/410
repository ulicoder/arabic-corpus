‘The Filter Bubble’ explores a simple idea: that personalization of our online experience curates what we see like: facebook and Google, potentially hiding viewpoints that we don’t like and limiting our view of the world. The idea is definitely worth discussing but I felt like Pariser’s writing didn’t always flow logically and occasionally jumped to conclusions that didn’t seem well-founded. I think an important message is that people have to be diligent about looking  for information. Don’t believe everything you read and don’t let someone else's filters and algorithm lead you down the garden path. And I think the filter bubble is bad for us because it isolates us from important things and so we have a bubble for our own thoughts and actions which a very small in a big world with full of many information.
