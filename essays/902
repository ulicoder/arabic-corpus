Single-gender schools are seen as a tool for improving the educational environments - is good for every student, its taken from the theme of varying learning styles different interests, it it's girls school or boys school. I think that single-sex education offers benefits for both girls and boys, it could be ideal learning situation for some boys and girls. Personally I am with single-gender school, it's a good approach, because the faculty at single-gender schools could understand how the students styles to those specific need.
I prefer to teach a female-gender school. In general girls are polite more than boys, with girls I sail in teaching my method in different ways which they can accept and learn in an interesting way. Females are more focused in lessons than boys. In my point of view they have the ability to memorize more, because of their interests in life, both have different interests.
