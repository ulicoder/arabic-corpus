To begin with, I enjoyed doing the presentation and I have a lot of different feelings about presenting my story to the class and of course to me also, such as: tension, anxiety, joy, enthusiasm and moreâ€¦
I worked with a nice colleague and we divided the work between us, I found that working with a colleague is fun and educational thing, because we learned a lot of things while working together based on our background knowledge, we shared information and learned from each other; after doing our presentation I noticed that the two of us presented in a messy way because we were nervous and what I will do if I presented again is to practice more on how to overcome my fear and I will practice also on how to present without making mistakes.
I presented the Lottery story by Shirley Jackson, it was a good and sad story and I learned a lot of things from it, for instance, how we accept out traditions without doubting and how we unthinkingly follow the members of our society, which is of course a bad thing to do and how the humans are cruel to each other which reveals our reality.
After I presented, I discovered some points that I was bad in and I need to improve them, for instance, the grammar, while I was presenting I did some mistakes in grammar so I need to develop my grammar more; another thing I discovered after I presented was that I should have focused more on the plot and talking more about the sequence of events in the story and if I had the chance to present again I will change these things.
