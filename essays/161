Starting school at 10:00 o'clock is better for teachers and students as both of them will have the opportunity to have enough sleep and not to be stressed when getting ready for school. Personally as a teacher, every morning is very difficult and stressing for me, as I rush to do so many works at a very short time, like preparing my kids, dressing them, preparing breakfast and their lunch boxes, as well as getting ready (myself) for a full day work. For students, i guess it's also the same issue, as they don't get their enough of sleep so they will not be able to focus during the first lesson. Finally, it is a preferable point to start school at 10:00 for both teachers and students, so that everyone can enjoy their morning quietly and less stressfully.
