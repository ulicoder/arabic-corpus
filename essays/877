Instagram is a social media app installed on smartphones to share photos and videos. Instagram users follow each other for updates or just to get information about variety of topics.
Despite the increasing number of Instagram users, some research show that it negatively impacts body image and life satisfaction especially among those who follow famous people (Dion, 2016). Furthermore, other research indicated that the more users spend time editing photos on Instagram the more they suffer from high level of self-admiration (Bryant and Sheldon, 2016).
Personally, I use Instagram either to pass the time whenever I feel bored, or to know more information about my students, their lives and interests. I feel that the more I know about my students and be informed with the last updates, the more I can change my lessons into a place where they want to be willingly.
I do take pictures of main events and projects but I don't rush into post everything on social media. I try to teach my students to live the happiness of the moment rather than just taking pictures of events they didn't actually live because they were busy taking pictures.
