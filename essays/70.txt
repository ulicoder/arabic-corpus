When I was a child I didn't remember hearing a bad words until I was 13 years old. However, the children in these days are different and even they use it with their parents and friends. I think possible reason of this is the television and the computer show programs and games containing words we would not accept in our classrooms. I said to my pupils that you could hear it but should not use it.
