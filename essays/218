Yes I agree, because the school should be a safety place for the students, that they need to feel like home. And teachers teach them usually in ordinary way, also did not take into consideration that they are teenagers, which means they need more attention. According to this realistic, it is important to ask the students about their opinion, if they satisfied or not. Also how they would like to treat because if they feel comfortable and safety and express about their feelings it will directly effects their grades and they can achieve better results. The character of teacher usually kind and she/he treats the students like her/his children. However sometimes some teachers exploit their position as a teacher and take advantages from that. Which make them treat with the students in authoritative way, which makes the student feel bad in the school so in this situation the management of the school should ask the students to evaluate the teacher, because if they found a problem they can solve it.
