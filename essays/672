Five years ago, we traveled to Aqaba in Jordan. There we visited so many places especially the Petra. Petra is one of the most seven amazing places in the world, it was a very nice experience, the hotel was very big and awesome, it has over five pools and playing places for childrens, we visited the biggest mall in Aqaba, it has over six floors, there I buyed my first Playstation it was very happy, this trip was one of the best trips for me. I hope that I can visit Jordan again.
