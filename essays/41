There is an ongoing debate about the length of the summer vacation. Some people argue that it is too long, whereas others believe that its length is fine. I believe that the summer vacation length is good.
First of all, as teachers we cannot travel during the school year. Consequently, we usually travel only during the vacations. Thus, having a long vacation is important to allow us enough time to travel. Second of all, usually in the last term student and teachers get tired from the routine. Therefore, having a long break help them prepare for the next year emotionally too.
To sum up, I think that having a long summer vacation is very important for the teachers and the students too. In my opinion it helps teachers and students prepare for the next year physically and psychologically.
