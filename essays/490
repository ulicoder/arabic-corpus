First of all, I believe that young people and older people can live their life free without problems and sadness but they must to know how to deal with the problems and make the right choices but, young people live their life best.
In the one hand, many young people enjoy in their life's but in the wrong way that’s way lead for them to the death for example: when a young ride a perfect car and her friend also they make a kind of challenge to race and the winner have the strong car that is make fun okay but in cases these fun lead to death. In the other hand older people can live their life in happiness, fun, traveling…
Young people have a full of energy and they still young's do not recognize what the life its they live their life's frequently without constraint. They can do different kinds of activities and actions. They try to make everything for fun.
Young people do not have a responsibility just like old people, they are not married do not own a house, children, wife, while older people have many responsibilities a job, a house, and kids and they must take care of them.
But, that’s not mean that old people cannot enjoy their life's, there are old people enjoy their life's more than young people. It relies on the person how he / she thoughts, how he / she deal with the problems they face.
In conclusion, if you want to live your life you can enjoy no matter how old you are because, happiness do not have a specific age. As a result you can make fun when you want and every time you want. You live your life one therefore make its fun to you and for all.
