Nowadays, technology devices are controlling the world and make our lives more easier such as cell-phones and computers. However, are using cell phones as educational tools during the lessons will be useful or will distract the students from schoolwork?
On the one hand, using cellphones as educational tool is possible and could be useful for the students. The students can use cellphones in the lessons to search for information, using search networks such as Google, or use the dictionary. In addition, using cellphones to write notes is easier than using pen and paper.
On the other hand, using cellphones during the lessons could be distracting. According to the survey conducted by Tinder and Bohlander (2011), 95% of the students bring their phone to class every day and 92% use their phone to text message during class time. The majority of the students also admitted they used their phones for browsing, sending pictures and accessing social networks during classes.
Furthermore, according to Lee, Kim, McDonough, Mendoza and Kim (2017) experiment, the participants who had their cellphone taken away preformed significantly better on the test than the two other groups who allowed to have cellphones during the lessons.
In conclusion, using cellphones as educational tools could be helpful and at the same time distracting. As a teacher and a student I see that using cellphones in class distracting and have more damages than benefits. However, I allow my students to use their cellphones or other devices to look up words or information as long as I observe them.
