I want to describe a place I go before. The zoo we go because I love the animals.
I went with my family and sister and her husband we saw their many of kinds of animals like the monkeys and the snakes and tigers also the elephants and we were give them food to eat.
After we finished we get to the restaurant and eat a pizza and this day was a happy day in my life and I want to come back and have fun like this day.
