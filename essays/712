Recently, many cities have begun banning cars from entering and hanging out in the city center. Though of the advantages of this policy, there are many disadvantages and consequences for it.
On the one hand, this policy probably makes it hard for section of the citizens. For example, it will make it severe for old people who have many health problems to get to their targets. In addition, the tourists who want to tour in many places in the city will find it intolerate and hard for them.
On the other hand, it is thought that banning cars from entering the city generaly contribute to descrease the annoyance in the city, owing to that it increase the quietness and the stability in the city.
Consequently, banning cars from entering the city center has positive sides and negative sides. We see that negative sides exceed the positive sides, so I completely disagree of it.
