I believe that homework is very important in student's life. It helps children develop their positive study skills and habits that serve them well throughout life. It allows students to review and practice what they have been covered in class. As well as to get ready for the next class.
Moreover, homework teaches students to work independently and wisely. It is also important for the parents because they know what their kids learn in school.
