Technology in the 21st century is power. The industry of technology is progressing very quickly. People are striving to make a career in the hi-tech world. It is a promising job in which you can provide well for your family and receive great work conditions. However, the percentage of women who seek a career in the hi-tech fields has actually fallen and decreased since 1985 according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology.
In my opinion many women today avoid studying computer sciences because they fear that they will not fit in this kind of business. This is due to the fact that they were not encouraged to pursue such careers. In many societies, girls were raised and taught that they belong inside the house, caring for their children and husbands. According to Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, girls do not pursue a career in high-tech businesses because TV shows and movies present male scientists as superior to females. These shows have a strong impact on girls. They grow up believing that they are inferior to male scientists and thus they do not have the courage to get into the field of hi-technology.
I believe that women in the computer business can be equivalent to male engineers. I myself, come from a family with more women as high-tech engineers than men. Besides, both my daughters are studying subjects that are related to computer sciences. Young women have proved to be as serious and as skilful as young men. We need to encourage and to educate both genders to pursue the career they wan and love, and teach our girls that they can exceed expectations in any field they want including the computer sciences field.
