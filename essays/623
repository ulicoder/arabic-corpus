My presentation talks about a random kiss story that I worked on it with another student and I think it is more beneficial to work with someone else because you can share ideas and to find better ways to finish things so, we have used a presentation website to do our presentation, a website that gives us multiple choices about designing presentations so it was very helpful.
In our presentation, we needed to talk about the story in short but it did not went as it should be so I think if I could have another chance to do it again I’ll focus more on talking about the important things and to talk in short as it should be.
In addition, I think the presenters should be more excited about what they are doing and that what was missing in our presentation I think it is because we were very confused and stressed so we needed to be more excited and to relax.
In our presentation, we were asked to prepare an activity for the class so we have chosen to let them talk about something they did for a good reason but it went bad depending on our story because it is centered on this topic, but I think it wasn’t suitable and not so interesting so I would change that for sure.
Finally, I should mention that working on this presentation gives me a lot like, there were things that we learned in previous lessons and I find out that it wasn’t clear for me for examples, the types of characters I was confused with it. I also learned that as a teacher or a presenter I need to give more to show that my work is well done.
