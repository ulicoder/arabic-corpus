from all the theories that we learned, i think that the natural source" bow wow" theory makes the most sense.
because i think the language developed by imitating primitive sounds from the surrounding environment and from the sounds around us.
so for example: it like when we see a bird or object flew by making coco-coco  sound we can imitate it and  indirect way we can make a sound.
the imitation of sound were then used to refer to the things that associated with the relevant sounds that mean that onomatopeia still exist in our language today such as splash rattle boom
it also related to the pooh pooh theory that its talked about that the human may started to make original sound by cries of emotions such as anger pain,fear surprise a shriek or a laugh or a gasp and  joy. ( wow oh ah ouch hey).
so the human's first words were derived from spontaneous expressions and instinctive cries.
