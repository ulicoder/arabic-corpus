I think that it must be a little of the two things in balance, an ability for the teacher to relate well with students and good knowledge of the subject being taught.
Nothing is more important than gaining knowledge but on the other hand being related to your students is something very important for a good and excellent teacher.
Gaining knowledge and this is why we send our kids to school so they would gain more knowledge not just in history and political things but also in math or even a every day use subject like languages.
Languages is a very important subject that they gain knowledge and is a very big reason why we as parent send our kids to school.
On the other hand if we look at a teacher in order to give the good knowledge and to know that a student really understand it and may use it in the future a teacher must relate to her student.
A teacher must relate to her students in may ways such as a teacher must be close to her/ his parents in order to see what a life style each kid in her class have, also that well help her find the personality of each student that they have.
Second a teacher must stay friendly with her student in order to be close to them and see what the difficulties that they have and try to fix them in a very professional way.
In conclusion we can say that both qualities of the teacher are necessary to have both of the abilities in order to be a successful teacher.
