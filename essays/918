A new language is a new culture, this is is what I have been thinking about ever since I finished my bachelor's degree. I was one of the honor students in my class. I was fond of learning English as a new language with its all aspects. Everything regarding learning English fascinated me from the different accents to the charming world of literature. I wanted immediately to enter the M.A. program, yet I did not because I didn't have the opportunity for that. I gave birth to my first child and I started a new job as an English teacher.
14 years have passed. All that time I felt the urge to lean more in an academic atmosphere. Further than just reading books, novels or essays. I needed new techniques to widen my horizons, new ideas and tools to teach that same language in the modern world. The language I have been extremely enthusiastic to learn for years. Today is my first day in the M.A. program. My expectations are high. My head is full of storms about what I really want or expect myself to be by the end of the program. All I really know is that I am expecting a major change in my perspective as an English teacher and a language lover.
