I would like to write about my decision to enter the M.A. program this year. I have a bachelor degree in sociology and anthropology from the Hebrew University. After 10 years of working as a research assistant, I have decided to achieve my childhood dream to become an English teacher. Therefore, I had my hassavah to English three years ago and started to work as an English teacher right away. It was one of my best decision that I have made in my entire life. Now I desire to fulfil another dream of mine, is to have an English M.A. So I can improve my statue in different levels.
First, I would like to improve my English skills along with my academic knowledge. For instance, to expand my vocabulary, my formal writing and my oral skills. Second, on the personal level, I'm looking forward to improve my social skills. Furthermore, fulfilling my dream I want to be a good role model for my students and specially for my children. Third, having M.A. degree will upgrade my academic statue as well as my salary at school. However, entering the M.A. program while I still a new teacher has its obstacles. Firstly, I have two little children at home that need a lot of attention and caring. Secondly, my economic situation is not bright as I am still a new teacher with a minimum wage. Lastly, I still don't have all the years of experience and knowledge that my classmates have.
