A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I disagree with this statement, because I think both of them are equally important.
Because the good teacher will make a balance between these skills, in one hand the ability to relate well with students is important because, in this way you will make your students like you and then they will like the subject that you teach and they will love to be in your class. In the other hand to have an excellent knowledge of the subject that being taught is important because, as a teacher you must have something to give to the students, a good material that you must give to them and make them understand it. I think that these two skills must be provided to the students equally from you as a teacher.
