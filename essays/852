Students at schools go out for a long stretch summer vacation for two months. Students rest and have a long time to play and have fun.
On the other hand, parents who work out during the vacation are facing a serious problem, since they do not have a safety place for their children what is more they do not find a babysitter.
In general, there are more cons than pros to summer vacation. It has a bad consequences on the effectivity of education. If there were no summer vacation, the students will get more information and the educational process will stay continuous.
Moreover the ability to exposure to the summer harmful accidents while walking around is rises during the vacation.
Despite all of this, summer is a time that all people like to enjoy and go out for picnics, thus children should take thier time to entertain and take advantage of the beautiful weather. Having looked at both sides of the argument, I think that summer vacation should become shorter. No need for two months, a short vacation during summer time will be awesome.
