Statistics show that 18% of computer science degrees in US down from 37% in 1985. One reason for that is probably because girls are less encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys.
I think that women's attitude towards computer science is affected by gender stereotype. This may prevents them to study computer science.
Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, advocates that this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists.
In my opinion, this claim is totally accepted, because girls in our society is less supported to be involved in the sciences while boys are encouraged to study this field.
