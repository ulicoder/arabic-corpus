Pupils in Israel enjoy the long summer vacation. However, both parents and educators believe that two months is too long a break from school. They believe that short vacation is more beneficial.
On the one hand, pupils like long summer vacation for many reasons such as spending more time with friends without taking into consideration homework assignments or even exams. In addition, a long vacation can contribute to less stress and more comfort.
On the other hand, educators always complain of long summer vacation for a significant disadvantage. After a long vacation, pupils forget the material.
Furthermore, they find it difficult to concentrate during lessons. Thus, they lose confidence and feel more stressed. Educators also notice how lazy and less motivated pupils become after the long summer vacation. We have to take into account that parents also complain in particular these who work for long hours. They find it difficult leaving their children at home for a long period of time. Parents rely on schools as a safe system that keep children away from hazards. What is more, parents cannot have enough money to pay for summer camps or other courses for their children to keep them secure.
To sum up, there are more cons than pros of long vacations. Pupils can enjoy short vacations and still motivated and confident through a continuous learning process without having long breaks.
