Getting up early in the morning is a hard issue. Especially if you didn't get enough sleep at night. And especially waking up for school.
Some students finds it hard. Because, they would like to have an extra hour for sleeping in the morning instead of waking up at 6:00 am in order to be at school at 8:00 am.
Students can't get the idea that waking up in the morning is a healthy habit. The idea of having an extra hour for sleeping in the morning makes them feel tired and sleepy.
I have been a student in school once, I didn't had any problems with it. In fact, it went very well for me and still does. I wake up at 7:00 am every morning, either for college either for making my day a day that worth living. Sleeping kills your day, your health, your positive energy and your life. It's okay to sleep and to rest but for a good reason.
To conclude, the idea of starting school a later time is useless and student can't benefit from it. It is true that it is hard to wake up early and leave your stuff at home and to go to school. However, when you get older you will realize the everything that you have is because you worked hard for and you have woken up early every day for it and you will realize also that sleeping is for rest not more.
