Some parents think that single-sex schools is better choice for their children, especially for girls.
Single-sex schools are not a good idea due to several reasons. First, having two genders in a class, makes a competition between girls and boys. Every gender wants to prove himself, that he is more clever, successful. So students will have to make more effort in studying. Second when we have two genders in one schools, it motivates the students to pay attention to their outlook appearance, to his cleanliness. Many human development professors indicate that the more you take care of you appearance and cleanliness the more you will be happy, you will feel more inner peace. So this will makes the students feel more comfortable in school and out school.
Finally, single-sex schools are not a good idea, because in life not every place have separate genders, in work or public places they have to deal with the other gender all the time. This should be a regular habit in their life not a rare thing, because in life it is normal.
