Single-gender schools are common in religious societies. In my society single-gender schools are not common. As a teacher, I am against single-gender schools. Human being are born equal. We are mentally and physically equally with males, so why to learn solely with girls? Essentially, I believe that students learn better in heterogeneous and mix gender classes. They learn from each other, they know each other better. We should not be concerned of competing with males or intimidated by males, because males are our brothers and cousins. If we did not compete with males in schools, it will be hard to us when competing them in daily life, or work in future.
To conclude, single-gender schools are not solid idea for me. Girls and boys should know each other, they should interact with each other to create balance in life.
