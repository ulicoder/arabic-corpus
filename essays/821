I do believe that the theory - "The Genetic Source" of how human language developed, is the most theory that makes sense in my opinion.
As we know about this theory, "babies are born with an innate capacity for language acquisition (start learning even before birth)". As the embryo develops and grows in its mother's womb, precisely when the brain builds up, the embryo begins to absorb what is going on around it and begins to acquire language by hearing even before it is created.
According to 'Rationalism – Descartes', human knowledge is not the sum of experiences, as other theories may say, we have something inborn knowledge. Not that the environment is unimportant, but it is not everything. We also need something from within that we are born equipped with. Also all humans are equal, but born with inbuilt wants and desires (e.g. the innate desire to be free) etc.
All are born equal with the same inborn knowledge, which is assumed to be common to all human begins.
Noam Chomsky, who was heavily influenced by rationalism, claimed that we have innate linguistic knowledge. All languages have something in common which is innate within us, and in addition, there is variation between languages. There is something innate in which all languages share some grammatical characteristics.
All babies have the 'critical period', in which a child must be exposed to a language, must receive stimuli from the environment, if he/she doesn’t, it will be impossible to have a mother tongue; something in the brain is blocked off. You don't need a grammar or a language to communicate, animals have communication systems. But without the grammar, there is not a language. That can be learned at any age, but without exposure to a language during the critical period, one will not acquire a mother tongue.
This weakens the other theories which say that the kid may acquire the language without engagement or
