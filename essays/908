In my opinion, single-gender schools are not a solid idea, for many reasons. First, a good competition between both genders is significant and fundamental in the process of learning. In addition, competition may lead to better achievement and better progress. Second, both genders should be educated in a manner to be presented to a society for many aspects in life, such as working. Thus, people need to adjust together as a part of their lives. Life doesn't depends solely one education but on how pupils are educated. Consequently, both genders need to work, learn and do things together to achieve and get ahead in life. Without getting encountered and intimidated we cannot make any progress. We need to attempt to adjust to different situations. Finally, learning together in one place can prepare them for life beyond the classroom. So when they learn together they can gain more confidence and power then they can get to a higher level.
Getting attention in a classroom is not the basic factor in succeeding. However, it reinforces and encourage pupils' self-esteem and motivates them to do better. To sum up, the benefits of mix-gender schools ranging from empowerment, confidence and self reliance. As a society we need to work and live as one cluster to provide solid education and an interesting life. Human beings need to adjust themselves to changes in their work in every part of their lives. Mixture communities are more successful than others.
