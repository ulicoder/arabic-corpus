I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
There are many reasons and facts that provide this statement. One of them is that older people have families and kids and job that they are responsible for, so they do not have enough time to have fun like young people.
However, young people or teenagers have enough time to have fun in their life's. They are not supposed to prepare dinner, or to do the laundry, or to wake up at 5:00 AM to prepare their children to school and to go to work after then. Yes, they do have schools and they do have homework's and they do have exams but that won't forbid them to go and to have some fun in their life.
But on the other hand old people can have fun in their life's. When we say FUN it is not necessarily to go out at nights, or to go the bar with some friends, or to go to parties at 1:00 AM. Fun is having a dinner with the whole family, and to watch TV together as a family, or to go to a trip together. Fun is different for teenagers and for old people, teenagers sees it as parties and goes out on night and old people sees with their families, or maybe at work with their mates.
In conclusion, as I said fun is different for old and young people. Both of them sees it in a different ways and do it in some different ways. All of us need to have some fun in our life's because we are only live once so we need fun in our life's.
