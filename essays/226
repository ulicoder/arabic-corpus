In most schools students start learning starting from 8 am. Lately, studies have shown that starting more late shows better results. In my opinion, I believe that starting school from 10 am is more beneficial than starting it from 8 am.
The first reason is that having enough sleep hours improves the students' performance in school. So, when students come to the classroom with more sleep hours, they would be more energetic and involved.
The second reason is that students should get enough time to do different things before starting school. Having a full meal breakfast or doing sports before going to school is more beneficial than just waking up and going straight to school.
As can be seen, starting school at 10 am is better than starting it at 8 am because students should get enough sleep hours. Further, doing extra things is the morning makes the student more active in school hours.
