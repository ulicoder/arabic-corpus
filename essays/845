Before many years the Arab people occupied Sicily, Sicily is close to Malta, after they occupied Sicily they occupied Malta, in that time ( after the Arab occupied Malta)the use of Arabic languages started in Malta and this is the reason of why 1/3 the words of Maltese language is Arabic. Then, the Roman came and occupied Sicily and Malta and there was not Islam anymore, the use of Arabic disappear because there was not Islam people anymore (Islam people were talk Arabic), then other came and occupied Malta and was so many languages because of the occupations. The Arabic language almost disappear.
The Maltese language is not a dialect of Arabic, it is a language by itself, the Maltese language has its own letters, and the alphabetic of the language differs from the Arabic letters. Maltese has diverged quite a lot from Arabic over the last 1000 years and has now become its own language. The syntax and grammar of Maltese remains Arabic and about third of the vocabulary is still Arabic and that includes most of the grammatical function words as well as a lot of the most basic vocabulary, about half of the vocabulary is from Italian and the remaining vocabulary is mostly from English and French. It is still considered a sematic language because of its Arabic origin and because of its structure, but if to take into account all of the foreign loan words, especially the romance loanwords then it is essentially a hybrid language.
