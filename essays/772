There has been a suggestion to ban the fast food restaurants in schools or in the contiguous areas. And me personally advocate this suggestion for a numerous major reasons.
First, fast food have a high amount of fat consequently eating fast food everyday in school will lead to overweight and obesity which are caused by the accumulation of fat in the body. In addition, this high amount of fat can cause to a heat disease also will cause to a major diseases that cause to die.
Second, I prefer to take food from home which I guarantee it is healthier and clean. Also, in this way, I will save money which I can use to buy something important than fast food. I will have a healthy lifestyle.
Last but not least some researches proved that eating fast food have a negative effects on students while learning and will cause to a sharp decrease in their focusing level and brain function.
In the light of the information mentioned above I see that fast food restaurants should be banned.
