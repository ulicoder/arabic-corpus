I think that driver's license at age 16 is very dangerous, because teens are easily killed by car crashes. More 16-20 olds get into crashes than 30-50 years olds, and be getting them of the road, it would save the lives of many teens.
Raising the driving age to 18 could prevent the death, cause by crashes of 16-17 year olds.
