A lot of people have considered the city center as a significant destination for shopping and having fun. As a result, many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center.
On the one hand, the city center is most of the time crowded with people and always has traffic. Banning cars from entering the city center can make people depend on the public transportation, so that will reduce the traffic and the pollution that huge number of cars may cause by releasing toxic gases, also people will think more of the public benefits instead of their own benefits.
On the other hand, if someone is in a hurry and wanted something from the city center, he/she can't go with a bus or a train, which will make him/her lose time by waiting.
To sum up, although banning cars from entering the city center may be harmful for a percentage of people, I believe that our city manage to give us the best for our lives by making our decisions. However, ultimately each person must consider that there are other people who live on this planet not only him/her.
