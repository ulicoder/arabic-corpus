At first I didn’t know what story to pick, at first I picked up a story called “The Kiss” I felt that the name could tell something special about the story, two days after I entered the list another time and saw the name of the story “Winter Dreams” and I thought about what could this kind of name of the story tells about. I picked up the story and read it online, I even searched for some videos on YouTube about the story to understand it more and to get more information about the characters and even their feeling. What I liked about the story is that how the love (even though the love in this story didn’t went well for Dexter), but it shows something special and how could love change a life, even if Dexter at the end stayed alone but he was very successful man, and I don’t think that he’s feeling regret for being a businessman, with reading and writing some points here and there I started doing my presentation two days before my presentation day and I feel very sorry about that, even though I read the story weeks before but I think that I could do better if I started reading and putting the important things before, to be honest it was interesting to work on the story and analyze it, I could learn a lot of things and depending on myself with understanding the material by my own.
