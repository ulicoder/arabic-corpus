Nowadays, tablets have proved to be an effective tool in learning. Even though textbooks will never be fully gone, the use of textbooks has decreased.
Today's students are the first generation to grow up surrounded by technology. In 2011, a study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt showed an increase of 20% in math tests scores of students after using iPads for a year.
On the other hand, Singer and Alexander (2016) found that although students preferred reading digitally and their reading was faster, their comprehension of texts was better on textbooks.
In my opinion, both methods should be equally used in learning. If a teacher can combine both the student will reach a higher level of understanding.
