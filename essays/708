People have always liked to hang around the city center by their cars. Many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center. Although this banning is controversial and likely to incite opposition, I am in complete support of it.
First, stopping cars from going into the city center can be a very beneficial thing. This banning will protect people from diseases. Most of the contamination can be found in the city center because of the gas that is released by the cars and pollute the air, then people breathe the same one!
Secondly, if this banning is enacted, it will decrease the car accidents. We know that most of the time people are in hurry. For example, a man who wakes up late and wants to go to his work that is located in the city center, he will drive the car faster, so the prospect that he will have a car accident is bigger. This policy will decrease this prospect hugely, because people will have to go by the public transportation.
In conclusion, there are many advantages which outdo the disadvantages. That is why I'm in favor of the new policy. So, the city must enact this banning and look for the best interest of people.
