There are many ways to learn a foreign language. In my opinion, the most effective ways are, going to live in a country where the language is spoken, taking lessons as part of a class, and studying on your own.
The way I see it, going to live in a country, where the language is spoken, is a more effective way and help us, as learners to live the language and use it in the original source. This option gives us listening, speaking, hearing, understanding, and using this language effectively and correctly. More over, living there led you combing the culture because in my opinion, the language is culture. Unfortunately, I do not have enough money to live the experience, and in the top of that, I cant leave my family (husband and the children).
Taking lessons as part of a class is a second chance for me a useful way to learn. Sharing and learning materials, with others, help us learn in a fun and productive way. I believe that the class is a small society - interactive and taking part our experiences and feeling together. I personally like this way because all the students motivate, support and encourage each other. However, this way takes time and money.
The last choice is studying on my own. We (as mothers and teachers) do not have the time to go out and study for along time. I personally, cant be away from my house more than one day. In addition, I teach at elementary school five days a week. As a result, the best way is studying at home with my self, in front of my computer or reading books. From my experiment, it is a useful and effective way. When I have free time at home I do it with enjoyment. But I have a problem, I am a social person and cant stay alone for along time and sometimes I get tired quickly - working in the computer. On other hand, it needs a quiet calm place - not a big full house.
In conclusion, it does not matter the ways, but the important thing is to look for ways help us developing ourselves.
