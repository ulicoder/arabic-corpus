I would like to describe a nice thing I did for someone. In usual day, when I was going to harbor I see old woman and medium height, petite and long curly hair and was worried and frightened. Hold a back bag after that he fall and I run to her and asked the woman: Are you fine? Can I help you? But he can't answer because she was scared then I help the woman and asked again: Are you fine? And he told me: I'm fine thank you for your helped and go to her trail and I to my trail.
