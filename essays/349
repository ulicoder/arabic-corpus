Homework is important, but I think that too much homework is not acceptable and it doesn't give positive effect on our kids. I think that the kids should have time for playing and doing what they love to do, as their hobbies. Many kids after going home, they refuse to do their homework because they become tired and bored from doing their homework. Despite fo the fact, that homework is considered to be kind of practice and reviewing for the material that they had learned during the day, so it is needed. One suggestion could be given to the teachers, that they have to give the students homework, but not always, what I mean is, to give them homework every three days, not daily. In addition, I think that homework can help the students to check their understanding toward the material, when they are do it alone in the house without the help of their teachers, also, this can lead he students to become more independent. In order words, they will have the responsibility to do it, and alone without any needed for someone to observe him or her. Lastly, I believe that homework should be given but not always because the kids must live their childhood and to do things they love, like hobbies.
In order to enjoy their moments, also to see their friends which means to have social relationships with others, not just to stay home and doing homework all the time with a lot of pressure.
