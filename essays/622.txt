First, our presentation was supposed to be on a different date, for some reasons from the college we made it earlier. My partner and I didn’t have the time to do it in the right way, we only had had a few days to prepare it and for sure it needs more than that, I was under a lot of pressure and scared that we won’t finish it in the time, but working in pairs made it easy and since Aya and I are close to each other it made it easier, we did not face any difficulties working together. If I go back in time and we had had a time I will prepare the presentation better and the martial itself, I will read and analyze the story carefully and focus on it since the story was hard to understand because there was a lot of description and difficult words. And for centrally I will prepare myself in presenting, I did not have the time to be prepared, and I will not read for the presentation, I did not read much but I won’t read any word. If I can add anything I will a creative question that will reflect the students’ personality and thoughts, the question is “if you were one from the Omelas citizen what will you do, would you stay or leave?”.
As I said during doing the presentation I was stressed and before presenting and I the moment I stood in front of the class I was nervous but during the presentation, my partner calmed me and then I felt comfortable and confident. Eventually, I learned that no matter how hard the circumstances are, we are able to achieve it if we believe in ourselves and I realized that I can do fulfill things under pressure.
