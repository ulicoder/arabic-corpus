There are some words in English that I don't like to use as an English teacher during the class, such as: six and always. When the student hear these words especially in high school, they started to laugh and whisper to each other. They relate the number six to the word sex. As a teacher I understand them because they are teenagers and they connect everything they hear to their own worlds. They also connect the word always to menstrual pads that women use during their period.
