Instagram is an application in which people can post, comment, share, like and dislike photos.
Through Instagram people try to depict their lives as perfect as possible by editing their pictures using different effects available in the app.
Once I was addicted to the app to the extent of waiting for certain events like weddings, trips, meetings, and etc. simply to post my pictures on Instagram and enjoy my followers comments about them. However, I started to realize how dangerous this could be. That is, I started to waste a lot of time on cellphone trying to edit my personal pictures to make myself look prettier and perfect, it sort of gave me a good feeling about myself.
Until I came across one study by Sheldon Bryant (2016) in which they concluded that the time people spent editing their own pictures for Instagram was significantly associated with their level of narcissism.
