I strongly believe that homework is pointless for both teachers and pupils. Pupils do enough work in school and they don't need more. For example when my daughter who is a pupil in the seventh grade comes home she wants to have fun by watching TV, playing computer games, playing the piano, hang out with friends, or do something. The pupils are in school for eight hours a day doing work and they want to go home to relax. Many countries around the world do not have homework such as Japan and Finland and they have the best education system. That shows that homework has not benefit. For me as a teach I think that it is just a waste of time and leads to bad grades. Learning should be in class and not at home.
