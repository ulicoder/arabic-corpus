Nowadays tablets are very effective in students learning at school and students like to learn on tablets instead of their books. While the value of a textbook cannot be erased, it is definitely a thing of the past. According to Singer and Alexander (2016), students loved learning through tablets more than print textbooks but they studied in a better way with print textbooks. And from my experience as a teacher, in my classes when I teach students an online lesson, I see that they enjoy it more than a lesson from a textbook. On the other hand textbooks lessons are more beneficial for them, they acquire the material in a perfect way. Another study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) said that pupils who used their iPads their grades in math has increased 20% in one year in comparison to students who don't use the iPads. As a teacher if I use the tablets in my school I think my students will be happier, and tablets will save a time for me in the lesson, it also will improve my creativity, engagement and my students' grades. Using tablets will give my students the ability to find the information as fast as possible and with textbooks it will simply never possible.
In addition may be it is something new and students enjoy trying new things and quickly feel bored with old or routinely stuffs.
