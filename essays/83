There are different perspectives towards giving homework to pupils or not. Some people think that giving homework is not necessary because of different reasons: pupils spend six to seven hours at school daily, which is a lot. Therefore, they should go back home just to play, relax and be free. other people think that giving homework is necessary in order to review and go over the material that has been taught in class. I support the second perspective. I am with giving the pupils homework. It is not necessary to be a long one, a teacher can give the pupils a short task just to make sure that they understand the material. I believe in short assignments or tasks in order to keep the pupils in all the time. In this case, if pupils get two or three task for different subjects it will not take more than one hour to complete them at home: they will also have enough time to spend on their favorite activities.
