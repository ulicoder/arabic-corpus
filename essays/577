I think that a teacher ability to relate well with student and the important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is the same, there are many reasons for being me convinced in my opinion one of them:
when the teacher relate well with her students she can pass her subject in very easy way.
Another reason, when the student know that this teacher treat well, he will respect her class, when the respect is exist I think the important excellent knowledge will understand in the same time, in short the ability to relate with the student and the important of subject being taught are connected to each other so there is nothing important than the other I think the two thing related to each other in other words the relationship between the teacher and her student must be clear when the student respect the teacher and the teacher respect her student everything will be good this is my opinion because the respect is the most important thing.
Finally, because this reasons that I had mention it's I think that the ability to relate with student and the important of knowledge of the subject is equally.
