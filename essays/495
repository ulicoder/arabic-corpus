I do agree that the young people enjoy life more than older people do, it's not because the general think like that but because the older people have more responsibility than young people have, and in that age they are exposed suffering from depression more than young people. While in the other hand the young people they are at the beginning of their life and thatâ€™s enough to give them hope, like if they made mistakes they can fixed because the life is in front of them unlike the older they starting regretting and maybe thinking that they will not find a big chance to fix it because their age is not too long. Also that the younger's passion and energy are enough basically to enjoy life. And they are healthier in contrast, older people usually suffer from some disabilities in their energy, moreover their limited time deprive them from experience new thing, discover new places and so on. We can look from the side that the older people priorities come first, for example their children, job, family, husband are more important than themselves, for instance when they have a limited money that the parents had saved from their retirement because the majority of them will stop working because of many reasons so they will give those money for their children or for the education or for traveling, or to buy a car or whatever... So they will not basically living for themselves but for others. But we cannot deny that those older have a good features to be at that age, such as seeing their children growing in front of them and doing some achievement in their life and sometimes those achievements can affect parents life in a good way, if they finished their learning they can help their parents to get out from their difficult circumstances if they have, also parents will feel more prouder about that, because they now fond someone who can take care of them, but some of them are not ready to help their parents, because a lot of younger leaving mostly for themselves. Finally I repeat my attitude that the younger enjoy more than the older do.
