we learned different types of theories of how human language developed. such as the "pooh-pooh theory" and the "bow-wow theory", "yo-hey-yo theory"...
In my opinion the theory I liked the most and felt that it makes sense is the "bow - wow theory" which is a theory that defines language originated in imitations of natural sounds, for example: the sound of thunder, dog's barking, the sound of birds, and more...
I felt that this theory makes sense because I believe that that sounds of nature are the original sounds of the universe,Â  "this theory suggests that the first human languages developed by natural sounds", and in agree with this saying. the natural sounds developed way earlier before even humans learned to talk or even make any sounds. It all started with the sounds of waves, waterfalls, thunders, wind, rain, etc...
humans and other creatures learned/started to make sounds after they heard the different sounds of nature.
Other theories are as important and make sense as this theory, but in my opinion that the human language developed by the help of nature and the natural sounds (as I mentioned before).
