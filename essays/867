The percentage of women working in tech fields and computing is lower than men. According to the National Center for woman and information Technology, in 2010 women earned just 185 of computer science degrees in US down from 37% in 1985.
I think that this drop related to the negative opinions parents and society give to girls along their teaching by discouraging them to involve in these fields. they exclusively relate tech jobs to men and opportunities available more to men.
Psychologically, Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, theorises that this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows like Revenge of the Nerds. Many young women today avoid studying computer science due to the fact that they fear they will not fit it. This fear grows through their rising in a society that treated them differently and gives the confidence to boys. Boys receive positive reinforcement to go into tech fields.
Indeed, early intervention and education will begin to close the gap between women and men in this fields. For instance, expose girls at schools to these topics as well as boys and build confidence into their characters. This may make them feel safe entering these fields and have the opportunity to select their career.
