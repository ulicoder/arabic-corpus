I heard a lot about "clean eating" but I never understood what they were talking about on this subject, where it was thought in my mind  about the "clean eating" that you wash the introduction thing more than once to be clean and the accumulation of dirt on it was my understanding of the thing only, but after reading the articles changed my concept of clean eating I found many different ideas about what I had to do to eat clean not just according washing the product more than once, but new and useful ideas. Eating clean is to pronounce our lifestyle not only in our eating conditions. Some people take clean food in the wrong way until they hurt their bodies rather than improve them and many people are suffering from malnutrition.
Because they eat very little of what they eat contains any real nutrients and the clean eating it is includes a diet consisting of untreated, non-refined, nutrient-rich food society has become more obsessed with fitness and nutrition than ever before, and as a generation we are fixated on an idealized image of health and clean eating has become an extreme, obsessive, psychologically limiting and sometimes physically dangerous disorder. As Susie said in her article "banning all of these important sugars especially the types of fiber which are required to keep bowels in good working order will sooner or later drop as does intake of B-group Vitamins" this drop of B-group vitamins can lead to arrhythmia and the clean eating that mean the person didn’t eat carbohydrates, sugar, dairy and this very bad because the body want basic compounds for body feeding fiber and "clean eating" cause an increased risk of osteoporosis due to the lack of calcium that is supplied from dairy products. In the end I want to say I am against this phenomenon  and I do not like it because it has negative repercussions on our body and our health and does not.
