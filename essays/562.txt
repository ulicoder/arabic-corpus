the common belief in our classes that the knowledge of the subject is more important than the realeashionship between the student and his teacher which is something that i am not agree with.
because if you treat your students in a good way or in unsatisfactory way also with respectfully way they will response with you in easily therefore you will have a good conclusions with them, from one hand they you can pass the materiel easily and your students will loves you more so they will come to your class with the enthusiastic to learn even if the material is boring and they cant handle with it, from the  other hand its better for you to have a good atmosphere in the class in order not to feel boredom.
a lot of experience teachers said that on.
e of the features of the teacher is to know how to handle with his students and to bee a good listener also warm and respectful also caring, also they said that a great teacher as high expectations for all students..
in the end i agree that the teacher who can deal with his students very will he will be a successful teacher.
