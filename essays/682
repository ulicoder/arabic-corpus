My brother prepared me a table with delicious and colorful dishes last week. There were different kinds of food like sweet ice cream, hot pizza, crunchy chips, delicious salad and more.
I really enjoyed everything on the table I wanted to thank him because it was one of my favorite meals.
I also told him that he is going to be a great chef.
