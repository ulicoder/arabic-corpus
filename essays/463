No one forgets a good teacher.
When I read this subject, the first thing came into my mind was my middle school teacher.
There is no words I can say to describe her. Is she a good teacher? She was the best.
That energy she had, everything in the class was under control. I remember she always say after she finished explaining: "if someone didn’t understand what I just explained, please tell me and I will teach you in a private lesson". She explains in a perfect way, even if the student don’t want to be attention, she believes in her students and give them another chance.
You can't say a good teacher about someone who just explain in a good way. A good teacher is the one who care and hope the best for his students and who had the talent to work under presser and bring out the best in their students. And this exactly what was my English teacher, she helped me in so many private situations. My only dream was to grow up and be someone like her, I promised her to be an English teacher, and here I am now make my dream came true and my made my promise.
