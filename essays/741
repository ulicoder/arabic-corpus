I want to describe a nice thing I did for someone. I and my family help my best friend when she was in problem. She was very sick and need money to treat. I started to collect a money and donation, but it was hard because we donâ€™t have many of money. My father stood by me and supported me. I was feel happy because I loved to help anyone and I loved to take hope from friends and everyone.
