My classes are so big. I teach third and fourth graders. Each class includes 38 and 39 pupils which is a lot. Thus big number of pupils does not give me the chance to work with each pupil. It is a heterogeneous class, in which it is very difficult to work with all the pupils at the same way and level. So, every time I try to plan my lesson to include different kinds of practice, keeping students working actively, and have a clear aim for every class. I think I could work and teach better if I have up till 18 to 20 pupils only in each class.
