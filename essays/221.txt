Using the telephone apps on smartphones is something popular today, because all the generation use the cellphones, but when we talk about today, people prefer to use Whatsapp and texting app rather than using the cellephone itself, because sometimes when we call someone on the tellephone he/she maybe exist in a difficult place with many people and they can't reply so it's more easy to send a message to someone and he answers your message in a comfortable way with explaination. Also, I think people mostly used texting app because they can share pictures and audios and many things but in the tellephone call they cannot.
