The age of which people are allowed to get their driver's license in varies among different countries. In my opinion, people should only be allowed to get their driver's license after they have reached the age of 18.
Young people in general could act in a very irresponsible way. Therefore, I think that allowing them to drive early may result in more traffic accidents. I believe that after the age of 18, teenagers may become more responsible. They will also be more aware of the dangers reckless driving may cause. Thus, it is safer to allow them to drive after they have reached this age.
