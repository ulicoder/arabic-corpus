I think that the teacher's ability to relate well with students is not more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I believe that if every teacher has the ability to relate well with students, students will feel that the teacher is making his/her maximum in order to give them an excellent knowledge so they should appreciate his/her efforts.
So I think that the one is relate to the other.
For example: when the teacher make the students feel that he/she is always exist in order to help them supporting and encouraging them they will try to learn hard in order to get always the excellent degree.
