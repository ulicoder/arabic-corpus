The phenomena of using the cellphones as educational tools are spread among students. Using cellphones at school are popular in the society. There are advantages and disadvantages for using cellphones as educational tools.
First, using cellphones during the class time is not good for students and teachers. This study is supported by Tinder and Bohlander (2011) who found the majority of students admitted they used their phones for browsing, sending pictures and accessing social networks during the classes. It distracts the students during the class time.
According to the survey conducted by Tinder and Bohlander (2011), 95% of students bring their phone to class everyday, and 92% use their phone to text message during class time. In this case, the students don't concern about the lesson, they will be busy of their cellphones.
Using cellphones today are very important educational tools for the students. This study is in contradiction to a study by Lee, Kim, McDonough, Mendoza, and Kim (2017) who found that the participants who had their cellphone taken away performed significantly better on the test than the two other groups.
In conclusion, it is not necessary to use the cellphones during the lessons, to be a good teacher who use new methods to teach the students. There are a lot of skills which the teacher can use them to pass the material to the students.
