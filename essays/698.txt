My dream job is to become a famous chef I am studying to get my bagrut certificate. I love food and I like watching mom cooking us meals.
I think I can succeed in this job because I like to fix delicious meals. my favorite chef is Aharoni, he appears in channel 10 every week, I enjoy watching him cooking wonderful and tasty dishes. also I want one day to travel around the world and taste different dishes from all over the world.
