Many people believe that students should not get homework after school. However, others think that giving homework is better for students' educational outcomes and enhances their learning among other things.
Homework is very essential factor in students' success. It keeps the content in the students mind outside the class. Practicing homework works as a reinforcement of the material, in order not to forget what they've learned.
On the other hand, many people are against giving student homework because they claim that it takes so many time, while they can do other activities instead of sitting and learning at home. As well as they claim that homework stress students out, and make them nervous and cause them anxiety.
To conclude, giving homework basically turns out to be very important, and its benefits are more than the other things they can do, because they are probably will spend their day playing video games, or go out, whereas, they can make their day well spent, by practicing and be responsible for their learning and keep up with their educational process.
