Everyone has goals in his life, and my goal is to be a successful, to have a lot of money and to travel around the world.
This goal is important to me, because I think if I have money and if I am successful woman I woudnâ€™t need anyone, and I will be more responsible.
To achieve this goal, I will study and work, then I will go to university after that I will work because I have a certificate I think that my parents can help me a achieve this goal.
I wish I can achieve my goal and to work in my certificate in order to become a successful woman.
