The BuzzFeed article mainly talks about a young lady who tried Korean beauty products for some weeks and every week she made a picture of her face to show us the changes. This article is informal because she was using words such as "What's up y'all!", "what the heck was going on"... etc. So that this type of article is mainly pointed to young audience because, in my opinion, K-Beauty and skin care is mostly one of the youngsters interests.
Whereas, the article "K-beauty The rise of Korean make-up in the West" mainly talks about the Korean make up and how it became a trend, it also gives evidence about K-Beauty. This article is formal. I couldn't see any informal words and I think it's also because this article is pointed out to young and old audience so that they use formal words.
To sum up, both articles are different from each other by the audience and the tone.
