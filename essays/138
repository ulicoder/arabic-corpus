These days with the development of technology, many things have changed and replaced, such as paper and pen. Nowadays people prefer to use digital items such as computers, smartphones and even e-books. Many people, especially young people, like to read e-books than paper books. There are researchers that support that. one of them is for PWC. He found that e-books sales were higher than print books sales in US and UK. But, it does not prove that e-books are better than paper books. In a study by Helm (2018), college students preferred paper books because of the tactile. In my opinion paper books are better than e-books for many reasons. First, books are designed for focus, but e-books are designed to distract the reader with links. Second, feeling the progress through a book.
