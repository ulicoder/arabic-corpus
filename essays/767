Fast food is one of the most popular food at the world. A lot of people don't have a time to make their food by themselves so they prefer to buy it.
Fast food has many effects and it has advantages and disadvantages for the students at school. On the one hand, making food at home to eat it at the school takes a lot of time so buying fast food is a good solution for that problem. On the other hand, fast food is not healthy and if the students take buying fast food as a habit so it is gonna affect their future.
At the end, I donâ€™t encourage selling fast food at schools for many reasons and I wish that all the schools to stop this bad habit.
