At the last month me and my brother Salih, we went to Eilat city.
There we went to many places like beach, hotels, malls, cinemaâ€¦ But the best place there in my eyes the ice mall, in the mall we skied and played snooker and bought a Playstation.
There we make friends from Eilat, we walked with them in the mall and eated together we played shooting game and I the winner.
And after this we go to back home and it was a nice trip.
