When I was 13 years old, my teacher told us about an interesting project in the school. The project was volunteering and learning a foreign language at the same time, If we volunteer in different places around town, we will had the opportunity of learning a free foreign language course. I was so interested for this project because I do not like to study on my own. I started volunteering in my town, I had the chance to help others and give back to my community, there were many ways to volunteer, for example, my friends who like children, they help at schools and they did a wonderful activities for them. Others pupils and I help clean parks around town and take care of gardens. On Mondays after school, we were learning the foreign language with a professionals teachers. We take it in different ways, private tutor lessons and oral lessons with all the pupils. I think both of the ways were effective and useful for us. At the beginning of the course, I thought it was going to be complicated and hard that to learn foreign language, but it was easy and an amazing experiences, I will not forget it ever. At the end of the course, we become a good English speaker i enjoyed speaking and chatting with my friends in different language. I recommended for people of all ages to give and help, because you also receive.
