We all know that teaching is not a simple job and that it is full of challenges, a teacher should know exactly how to send his/her message to his/her students.
The teacher's ability to relate well with students and his/her excellent knowledge of the subject that he/she is teaching are both very important in teacher's job, therefore that both things are related to each other in different ways:
The first thing is that the teacher can't rely in one ability of the two abilities above and ignore the other one because if he/she do not relate well to the students, the student wouldn't concentrate with him as well and the message or the material he/she is teaching would be incomplete.
Second reason is if the teacher decided only to rely on his/her excellent knowledge of the material and to ignore the good relation between him/her student then the result will be the same in my opinion, and the student will also miss connect to their teacher and the message will be incomplete.
The relationship between teacher and student shouldn't be weak and it have to be built on true "will" in teaching and studying from both sides.
The students also have to know how to relate to their teachers to get as better as they can of the materials they have to learn, therefore that they also have to be aware of that good relation with their teacher will benefit them in result.
I think that the better way in dealing with this subject is that the teacher should learn how to balance between the two abilities and also to teach his/her students how to be aware of a good relation so they both can win.
