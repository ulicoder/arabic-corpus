I think asking our students to evaluate us or their teachers is something good for them, because it helps them feel more fully engaged in their education. And give them the chance to express their opinion about the teachers and the lesson itself.
Moreover, the student feel that his opinion is important and matter for the teacher, that for the lesson become enjoyable and effective.
