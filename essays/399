I never heard about the term of clean eating, but I have met a lot of people who do diet but not like clean eating diet because clean eating is about ingesting nothing but unprocessed foods, in other words, people who don't eat food with containing additives. It's true that in general it means to eat less processed food and more whole, fresh food and it is harmless, but they don't consume carbohydrates, sugar, dairy, grain or legumes they just take it in small units. At first people will see a good results but when they keep eating in that way they will have a disorders in health.
And as the novelist Susie Boyt said: "I long for the days when clean eating meant not getting too much down your front" and I agree with her, in the past people just do diet in simple ways and eat in a healthy way not in "obsession" way, worrying if their food contains carbohydrates or sugar etc.
For example, those who choose to avoid dairy, the dairy important to our bodies because it contains calcium, and if they didn't take it for months they will damage their health and eventually have osteoporosis (as it said in the article). And because all of that I don't agree with the clean eating phenomenon.
