Before two years, I went with my family to the south of Israel, it was a Jeeps trip. At first I enjoyed this journey, but we went mountains there was a big hole of water, I don't know how to swim but my family encouraged me to jump to the hole. It was the dumbest thing that I did, I jumped to the hole the death was nearby I thought it the last seconds in my life but my friend Basil saved me I was scared from that and won't back to water again or forgot what he did. He saved my life and I wish to do the same thing to him.
