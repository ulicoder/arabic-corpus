We as parents wait for the summer vaction especially for whom have kids. We don't have to worry about exams, quizzes or studying process. There is no studying. It is less pressure for all, parents and kids. In addition, summer vacation presents a great chance to go a long trip with the family; last year we went to Germany for two weeks forgeting all the worries about everything. As a teacher, summer vacton gives me the opportunity to relax and read some novels that I cant read in the rest of the year. The only disadvantage is getting back into the normal routine in the end of the vactaion.
