Summer vacation is a school break in summer between school years and the break in the school academic year. Negative aspect that summer vacation is too long a break of school, however, the positive aspect it's a good idea to be two months long.
This period is not too long to have vacation. One one hand, I see that it's significant for both students and teachers, they take a rest. They return back to school full energy, furthermore they begin school with great interest.
Nevertheless, in my point of view two months is too long, students are disconnected for studying, we need to prepare them before the school, because they need to be fresh in their minds.
The positive aspect of making the summer vacation short is that the rest of the children doesn't fit with working parents. Some parents are working, what is more they don't have someone to take care of their children.
In addition to what was mentioned above, children can lose their learning skills, because they don't study at the vacation. They even refuse to to do a revision of the material which they learned before.
Even though that is true all of use need a rest, so I think the whole family should take a break at the same time to get a good effect, to return fresh and active to work or to study at school.
