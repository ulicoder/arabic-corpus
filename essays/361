This essay will introduce different opinions about the influence of Pokémon Go game.
According to Sarah Jeong, Jeong argues that " Pokémon Go kept me outside and active, and it turned out that searching for the adorable little monsters in augmented reality gave me a new way to enjoy the city around me — I spent days discovering historical landmarks, parks, statues and street art all around the places Pokémon were hiding".
In other word, Jeong believes that the game helps her to be active because she interacts with the environment, and this game gives her sort of enjoyment in the city.
According to Kristen Race, Race argues that " Most kids today spend the majority of the school year with their brain already in a state of stress, and staring at a screen while trying to hurl Poké balls at Mewtwo further activates the fight, flight or freeze part of the brain. Even though a child may be playing this game outside, his brain is functioning in the exact same way it would if he were spending hours in an arcade".
Basically, Race is saying the Pokemon Go game is causing damage for the brain of the children that they spent a lot of time playing it.
Both on the one hand I agree with Race that staring at a screen while playing the game flight of freeze part of the brain. But on the other hand, I am not sure I believe that the brain is not functioning the exact same way it would if he were spending hours in an arcade, the brain could be affected by the environment around while the child is playing the game.
