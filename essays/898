I have been thinking of entering the M.A. program for many years, this year I have made my decision since I do not want it to be late. This program will be a challenge for me. The studying, the tests, the assignments, in addition to my career as a teacher in the field.
I believe that this program will not be easy, but it will be exciting and I am going to enrich my knowledge and develop my character as an English teacher, hoping to continue to Ph Degree. Knowledge is powerful and when I have an M.D. degree, I can be an English counselor.
I have been teaching for 28 years and I am a mother for 3 adults, so I have the time and the energy to study. my family encourages me and they can help me when I need technological advice.
As a teacher, the program will help me in my teaching process. I think the program will add new thoughts and new experiences to me. I have this feeling that the M.A. program will help me to achieve myself and my ambitions. I have this dream to be a TV presenter or journalist and M.A. will help me to develop myself and have another career after retirement or even before. I expect that the program will give me self sufficiency and will strengthen my personality and enrich my skills.
