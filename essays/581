Teachers should have the ability to relate well with students, and provide the knowledge of the subject being taught in the classes. These two elements should always come together but in some conditions will not be harmful to give one more importance than the other.
On the one hand, it is fundamental to teachers to give their students' knowledge and teach them everything they are supposed to have during the semester, because without acquiring new things and enriching their knowledge students will not improve and be educated, also the main concern for teachers to have during their classes is my subject being taught well with effective methods? Is it working?
On the other hand, sometimes giving students information, knowledge and everything came to the expense of relating to the students, this is wrongly misused concept, teachers job is not only teaching materials they supposed to be educators and concern about their students and relate to them as if their own children. Knowing when student "A" is not feeling well and why is he so good in classes and do everything in the right way and collaborate with the teacher in class but does not get high grades in exams, relating to students will solve this.
Basically these two elements that I have discussed should come together and to be balanced equally because it is not effective having a teacher who is only good in classes and teach the materials well and give knowledge, but cannot relate to students.
