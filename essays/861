In Israel, summer vacation is approximately 60 days break from school. Teachers and students start to make plans for the summer vacation months in advanced. However, parents are less enthusiastic about it because they still have to work.
A major advantage of having a long summer vacation is that students and teachers can have the opportunity to break their daily routine and have more free time for themselves. During school time, students and teachers are under great pressure in preparing for exams, homework, and assignments. Furthermore, both teachers and students get tired and pray for this vacation to come. Another positive aspect of long summer vacation is that students can improve their social skills by going on a long trip with the family or friends. This way, students can enjoy and improve their relations with other members of the family in a relaxing and enjoying atmosphere.
On the other hand, there are disadvantages for long summer vacations. One, students tend to break all rules and routine that they used to have while having school. This might cause problems for, both, students and parents.
Having looked at both sides of the argument, I may say that summer vacations are important for all sides. It is essential to get some rest from all the duties teachers and students have during school time. However, the government should find a suitable arrangement for the working parents, so they can have more time with their children.
