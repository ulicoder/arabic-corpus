Being a teacher is not an easy job, it requires many things from me, to be prepared every single lesson, to have new ideas, new thought, new tools as well. For me, I alway make sure to search for new stuff, pupils need to see variety of strategies. A teacher has to get pupils' attention and interest, otherwise lessons will be boring for them. Being exposed to new strategies in the second degree learning or in any academic learning provides us with power to move ahead and to give ourselves an opportunity to expand our knowledge.
Personally, choosing to enter the M.A. is also a matter of breaking the daily routine, being at school as a teacher for five days a week, it is so enjoyable to come back to be a student again. Doing new things is not always a matter of knowledges, it is sometime to experience new adventure. I think this experience will add a lot to me, personally and professionally.
