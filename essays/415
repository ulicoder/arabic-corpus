"Clean Eating" isn't as good as it sounds like.
Clean eating is the belief of eating whole foods in their most natural state and avoiding carbohydrates, sugar, dairy etc. I've known about clean eating all the time and has always been against it, but the article "Too Clean? Potential dietary deficiencies of clean eating" made me understand this phenomenon more.
Natural food is indeed good for the body but not as an everyday routine. As Susie said in her article "banning all of these important sugars especially the types of fiber which are required to keep bowels in good working order will sooner or later drop as does intake of B-group Vitamins" this drop of B-group vitamins can lead to arrhythmia.
Moreover, it can cause an increase in the risk of osteoporosis due to the lack of calcium which is provided by dairy products.
So that, I strongly disagree with this phenomenon due to the effects it causes. People who takes this phenomenon seriously I suggest them to stop it because in the long term they'll face severe consequences in their health.
