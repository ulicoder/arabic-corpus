Everyone has goals and work hard to achieve them. And I have many goals, one of them is to become a football player, but I think that its impossible because there is no supporting and understanding in our city. It is important to me because I like to be a famous player, if I want to achieve it I must to go to the big cities in the country, but it is so hard to travel to far places alone and maybe I will lose my education.
