Concerns about the use of technology in class for classwork, homework and educational games have become one of the major issues discussed in the educational field. In this paper I intend to discuss whether tablet computers should become the primary way students learn in class or the use of such technology will end up distracting students.
In this context, one study conducted by Singer and Alexander (2016) found that "school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbooks".
Another research done by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), intend to show the disadvantages for the use of technology, found that students who use tablet computers showed a drastic increase in one year comparing to those who used to learn through traditional textbooks.
To conclude, students around the world have different learning styles, thus, the use of each method depends on how each student perceives the material.
