Phone calls are an easy way for communication as well as texting, but some people prefer texting over calling, because it's a faster way for communicating with others. A study showed that telephones' apps that are used for calling are less used and a minor number of people like it, and 75% of Millennials prefer texting.
Texting is a very easy and simple way for communication, talking Whatsapp as an example: Whatsapp is one of the most used applications in the world. The majority of people use this app and find it a lot easier and faster for communicating with others, and it provides us with different ways of texting, due to the fact that people can take pictures, send pictures, send stickers, messages, gifs etc.
Another point of view is that, participants do not like the small talk and they need for an immediate reply. Therefore, they choose to use the texting apps and sending messages over calling, because they can text for hours without feeling any pain, because while calling, the long use of phone that it's attached to the ears, leads to inflammations and redness of them. But texting has no harms, and it barely causes any pain. In conclusion, ten years from now the numbers of phone calls made will be less and the use of texting will increase, because it's more than obvious that, the texting apps will be developed more than today and they will make them easier and more fast.
