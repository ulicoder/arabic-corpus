No one forgets a good teacher.
A good teacher can be good because they teach well and actually gets students to understand the subject well. A good teacher, maybe because he / she connects with the students and actually develops some kind of relationship with students, as in they become friends. Alternatively, both.
Some teachers can even be strict and demanding that you might see the student starts to hate them, but because of that, the student is actually getting better, understanding the subject more than before, and it is actually for the student to see that it was all thanks to the teacher. Speaking as a former high school student, I know that many students do not see that in the teachers.
Moreover, no student forgets a "good" strict teacher. In addition, I bet eventually they will say, "That teacher was always strict", "gave us homework all the time", "was demanding" or "his exams were hard". In the end, students will realize that that is why he/she is a good teacher. Honestly, they would not have admitted that during school days, now would they? They would just complain about everything, that is the specialty of SOME students.
Other than what the teacher teaches, some students develop a good relationship with the teacher that they become friends. Speaking from an experience here. I have had a hard time in junior high school and I will never forget the teacher that helped me through it, not to mention she was my English teacher, an amazing English teacher she inspired me a lot to become an English teacher. In addition, she is my favorite teacher. Ever.
Lastly, I just hope students will learn to appreciate teachers more.
