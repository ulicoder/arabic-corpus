Since I'm a very moody person, I like all the season without any exceptions, I wait for the next season patiently. Now, it's winter. I adore rainy, snowy and cold days. I like to war the coats, scarves, and warm hats. Spring comes later. I like it as well as winter. But, I hate the hot windy days because I feel "dry". Then, summer comes. I'm in love with everything relates to sea and swimming. Although it's hot in Israel I think it's ok. There are air-conditionings everywhere. I just cannot live without it. Last, fall comes. Hoe glamour is fall! I think it's so romantic. I feel good when I see the yellow leaves everywhere.
