My favorite season is spring. I like spring since it is almost sunny and warm. It is not hot or cold. It is very convenient, I don't have to wear all these jackets and sweaters. It is easier even for me to move and to go everywhere with my kids even especially in the morning whenever it is cold. It makes me so much tensed to let them put on all these jackets in the morning when we have to leave to school. I even like spring because I feel so much encouragements and energetic to do things, to wake up in the morning, to start my day with the sunrise. It makes me so vivid, active through the whole day. I like making plans outdoors with my family in spring since it is not too hot or too cold, these are two conditions that my limit my actions. I like nature and doing much activities in nature, that would inspire me and reflects positively on me.
