I disagree with the futuristic policy of banning cars from entering the city center because in my opinion seriously it is not gonna happen, for some reasons: firstly, if they ban cars from city centers, it will not be city center no more!
People will stop going there because they will need to walk everywhere.
Secondly, It's very easy to sit and say 'ban cars', and it's a view that I have some sympathy with. I lived in Tel Aviv and it's often snarled up with traffic.
However, so often the people who say 'ban cars' are talking from the privileged position of being able-bodied, in good health and so on. A move to ban cars in city centers would have to take into account those who don't have the luxury of full health and mobility. We need to be careful about talk that excludes the disabled, for whom a car ban would be a nightmare even in a city as big as Tel Aviv.
