Most of the teenagers today go to sleep late. They use electronic devices till late and that makes them wake up tired the next morning of school.
I believe if the school management and those who are responsible and set up the rules and laws for school agree to start the school day late, let's say at 10:00 for example, then I think students will be more focus and organized, besides they will understand the material much better.
Today, with the existence of globalization prevail, students are so affected by the new electronic devices they have in their hands, they are addicted to them as if it's part of their lives, so we can't tell them to go to bed early because they have school tomorrow because they will not listen.
So I agree that the perfect balance or solution to this problematic issues, is simply to start schools at 10:00.
