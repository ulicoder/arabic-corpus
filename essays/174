Nowadays with the raise of digital technology numerous physical things, for example, pen and paper are gradually being supplanted by computers and smartphones.
Many higher education students tend to prefer the use of paper books. In this regard Helm and colleagues (2018) found that "participating US college students preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided." As a college student I highly agree with Helm and his colleagues findings, as a student who needs to read many books, paper books are always the best choice.
However, many people around the world tend to choose e-book rather than physical ones. In this context many statistics found that digital books sales were higher than paper books sales. One study among several studies conducted by PWC Consulting (2019) found that in 2018 e-books were requested more than print books.
To conclude, reading either paper books or digital ones is a matter of choice, each and every person chooses what is more comfortable for him/her, what can be easily available, or what she mostly prefer.
