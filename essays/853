Summer vacation is one of the most events for students because they are waiting it so badly. As the end of school gets closer, students start making plans of how to spend their summer vacation. there are many reason why they should do this vacation. The biggest advantage of having summer vacation is that the student in these days are free to do whatever they want and to be free of lessons all the day. Everyday, students are under pressure to complete homeworks and to prepare for tests and quizzes. However, students need to stop from getting bored of school life, they need to be rest.
In addition, summer vacations can be a great chance for students to go on a trip with their families. Released from stressful school work, students can enjoy and make a good memories during their vacation. On the other hand, the summer vacations disadvantages that these vacation can disturb some students daily routines, when student realize that there is no school, they don't need to wake up early in the morning. Therefore, they tend to stay up late and to wake up late, when students used to do that it gradually becomes a habit, which can't be fixed easily.
In my opinion summer vacation is so important for student to manage their brain and to have some rest to continue in fresh mind.
