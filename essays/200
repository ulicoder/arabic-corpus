Smartphones provide its users different ways to communicate according to the need and goal. According to RIT researchers the participants who prefer to get an immediate reply choose calling as their tool of communication. Moreover, calling helps people to convey their emotions more sincerely than in texting because of the influence of the tone of the voice.
However, my calling habits include both calling and texting. Before I make a call I usually send a text message to the person I am calling so that I would call at an appropriate time. Therefore, texting is helpful because it allows the person to answer when he/she free but it sometimes can harm the texter because of the delay in replying. While calling mostly ensures an immediate reply, it can also be irritating to the receiver when it is done in the wrong time.
Nevertheless, calling is always going to play an essential tool in communication because many prefer to get an immediate answer and get the job done. Moreover it is the best tool to use during emergency cases, just imagine texting 911, help will never come.
In conclusion, smartphones provide people with different ways to communicate. But people choose the best method according to the situation they are in and how fast they want the reply to be.
