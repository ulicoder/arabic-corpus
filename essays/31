My favorite season is autumn. I love seeing the leaves change color and hearing fallen leaves crunch my feet.
I enjoy the weather when it is rainy, stormy, and sunny all mixed together. I enjoy listening to music while driving my car in these days. The worst thing in autumn that it gets dark and cold early. However, it still nice to stay indoors with your family watching a movie or playing some games.
