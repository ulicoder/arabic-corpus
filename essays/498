I agree with the statement "young people enjoy life more than older people do", in my opinion young people passion is enough to enjoy life more than older people do.
First of all, considering that most of the fun activity needs a lot of energy, young people have more energy than the older ones. For example, the sport activity it's fun and you need a lot of energy to do it.
Moreover, young people don’t take that a lot of responsibility like the older people, for example the older people have to take care of their children, and they have to work to bring them foods and clothes and other things that their family needs. So that make them more limited to enjoy life.
Additionally, technology is one of the most enjoyable thing in our life. young people can easily follow the technology compare to the older people. For example, we are using social media, that’s make us closer to our friends, and also social media helps us to create new friends. so the more connection creates more friendship. And the more friendship means more enjoyable life.
At least, parents sacrifice a lot for their children and that’s make them more limited to enjoy life from my point of view.
In a conclusion, young people enjoy life more than older people do, for the reasons that I mention above. But that’s does not say that the older people don’t enjoy in life.
