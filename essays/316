Having the world and school more modern and fill with technology, more devices and tablet computers must and should be applied in schools and to replace textbooks.
According to a study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) shows that students using their iPads increased their math tests and this considers as a support to apply tablet computers and to replace it with textbooks. However, replacing textbooks with tablet computers will affect the students learning process. This can be supported by a study conducted by Singer and Alexander (2016) found that school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but, learned better when they used print textbooks. All in all, having an iPad in class can make the teacher's and students life easier. It is easy to carry and is not heavy. Therefore textbooks should be replaced with tablet computers.
