The city center is the most important area in the city that has everything in it and provides many services to the audience. As a result, the center is always crowded, and banning cars from entering it is controversial.
On the one hand, if cities have banned cars from entering the city center, we would face many problems. For example, commercial stores in the center will face economic conditions difficult because the few visitors to the center, and the people who live in the center of the city will face time problem and other problems in their life.
On the other hand, traffic congestion in the city center will be significantly reduced. This reduces air pollution in the center of the city.
In conclusion, I suggest that they allow to enter the cars only for two or three hours to the center of the city in the day. This will satisfy both the opposing sides and the consent.
