I agree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate to the students is much more important than having excellent knowledge about the subject he is teaching, because if the teacher doesn't relate with the students and doesn't converse and create discussions about the subjects he is teaching with the students, he won't be able to send the message of the subjects that he is teaching, and the teacher should allow them to ask questions and release their concerns in order to enable them to understand the subject that are being taught in class in the best way possible, and the teacher has to explain each subject well and try different ways to make the students understand the what is being taught in class in the easy way, to make it easier for them to absorb and understand the subjects and material that they should understand and memorize. In addition the I think the teachers relationship with his students and his ability to control and understand their need is has a higher privilege and is more important, because it would make the students admire and love their teacher and it would make them get interested in the material in the material they are being taught, and would make them search for information and study for it well and that would make succeed in exams and get high scores on the material, and the teacher's love and understanding for the students will make them become positive and more hardworking to achieve their dream to become better in life and in their future job and it would make remember the teacher and admire him till the end and they would praise him to others.
