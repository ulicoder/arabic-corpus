Personally I agree with the idea that classes should start later, not early in the morning. Students and teachers will get more hours of sleep and that makes them perform better at school. When they get more sleep, they do well at school and they will have more balance and they will be more relax. Personally a later start time of classes can improve my performance at school it makes me more relax and calm because I need enough sleep to be creative and active during my daily life.
