Air conditioning are the lifesavers, and it's mostly used in summer. It helps us to feel better and cooler. They are used in stores, offices, classrooms and in our houses as well. People will not survive summer if there are no air conditionings. Therefore, and because of the fact that our countries are hotter nowadays, the use of the air conditioning is increasing. In my opinion, air conditioning is the best solution for summer. However, many people find that it is too expensive, therefore they prefer buying fans, instead of air conditioning. In this case stores and sellers should decrease its costs and to make it cheaper for poorer people.
Moreover, Murphy (2015) writes that being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores which unfortunately true, and this truth is wrong and should be changed. As I mentioned previously, air conditioning sellers should make their costs cheaper, a possible cost than all buyers are able to have, and it's suitable for their potential.
To sum up, and generally speaking, most of the people prefer the use of air conditioning even if they do not suit their budget, because the ozone layer is destroyed by us, and the earth heat is increasing. Therefore, there is a huge need fo air conditioning.
