My presentation was about the story "The Tellâ€“Tale Heart". I did it with Raneen Ahmoud. We choose this story because it full of mysterious events, also the background of the author was exciting which make us interesting in doing a presentation about this story. We work hard in order to prepare the presentation. Our purpose was to make everything clear for students. We present the story in the classroom in front of our classmates. I was confident that it will be a great presentation, we work hard to do it. During the presentation, the students were focusing with us which me make me feel comfortable to presents in front of them.
In the presentation, we explained about the author's background, the events of the story and the characters, we almost paraphrase what was written in the slides. At the end of the presentation and after explaining everything relate to the story, we did an activity, Kahoot. We choose this activity because we think it reinforce the student's understanding which help them to memorize what have presented.
I think it was a good presentation, however there were some grammar mistakes and pronunciation mistakes. In the next time, I would like to do it in different way and to create more creative activity than Kahoot.
