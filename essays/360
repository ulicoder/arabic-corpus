Technology play an essential role in our lives, most of people use technology during the day, which can be good thing or bad thing, using technology during the lesson for learning purposes can be a good thing, however, when the students us technology specially tablets, they will be more encourage to use the tablet without having attention to material that it is inside the tablet.
According to Singer and Alexander (2016) found that school students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print textbook, which support the idea that using tablets instead of textbooks can be good thing and bad thing because the most important point in school is the learning process and when the students are encouraging in using the tablets rather than focusing in the material itself, they will be losing points, however, using tablets may improve the students in a certain topic, for example in math, according to Houghton Mifflin (2011) showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year. Which shows that using tablets might improve the students skills.
To conclude, using technology especially tablets instead of textbook might have a positive impact on the students achievements.
