Single-sex schools are a good idea for increasing the single-sex students' success. Separating each sex from the other in education, may lead to improving students grades, as well as, it contributes to personal and self-development. The idea of dividing both sexes focuses on achieving a better success, because the concentration on the lessons becomes higher, and grows. It is a way for students to learn how to behave and respect the opposite sex, without having distractions and competitions.
Single-sex schools provide students with more and diverse activities. Each sex will feel more comfortable in his own schools and not restricted. Students will be able to concentrate more during the lessons, because there are differences in the methods of achievement between boys and girls, and this gives an opportunity for teachers to reconcile the manner of his/her explanations and giving instructions in a way that is appropriate for their levels.
As many studies showed that girls brains grow and develop faster than boys in their childhood, but that doesn't indicate that girls are smarter or more capable of learning, but shows that girls have different ways and methods of learning. They might rely on their different sensory skills, while boy rely on their movement skills.
In addition, the idea of separating both sexes helps the teachers a lot. It gives the teachers more opportunities to work on solving students achievements, without causing embarrassment to either sex, because it's easier for them to express themselves freely in the presence of mates/members of the same sex, without the presence of the opposite sex.
To sum up, single-sex schools are a very magnificent project, that many schools should adopt, and to work on achieving it as soon as possible.
