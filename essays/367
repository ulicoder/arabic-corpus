When I read the topic of the article "clean eating" the first thing that comes to my mind is that the article will talk about the diet that I use to do, (less food) but after I read the article I found that it talk about something different, it talks about the clean food which is a (healthy food). I understand that the people should have a clean eating and healthy food in their style life in general. And they have to be aware for every plan that they do in their eating habits.
In the first article: "why we fell for clean eating"
The article gives us an example which was about a girl which is lose her hair the reason of that was because she eat unclean food in unclean way.
The purpose is to achieve us to eat an healthy food in healthy way because our body has to be healthy.
In the second article: "too clean?"
it shows us that changing our food diet can be harmful sometimes also that the diet is not good sometimes to our body.
The third article: "clean eating goals you should know"
It gives the people who is following a diet schedule  some steps to be more healthy people and it aware them about what they have been eating, they don’t have to eat sugar and the things that affective badly in their body, these things haven't to be in the schedule diet.
The purpose is to make the people eating an healthy food because that’s important for who making diet or who wants to lose weight.
From my  point of view: we have to eat a clean food, the clean food have to be a part of our life, we have to eat in healthy way and a healthy food all the time it have to our life style eating then we wouldn’t have to follow a diet schedule  and we have to remember that the diet (the unhealthy diet) can be harmful to our body.
