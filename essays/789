There are many school that use technology in their class. Using tablet computers in schools adding new features, applications, and creative opportunity for students in future to organize their writing on the tablet. Because when students use tablet replace textbook they have the ability with their teacher to communicate for homeworks faster than when they write it in the textbooks.
According to Singer and Alexander they prefer to use tablet computers in school to learn better. In addition of a study by Houghton Mifflin support the study of Singer that students when they use tablets, they increase their scores in class more that when they using traditional textbooks.
According to these studies many school fight against of putting tablets computers replace the textbooks because schools argue that these tablets are a cost burden on the school district as they have to pay much.
In my opinion and as I read the study I prefer that each school should consider to be the best for their students and to give them all the ways to make them more relating and to love what they do.
When students using tablets they will develop their mind and they will use it faster that they use pencil to write on the textbook.
I think that it doesn't matter if the tablets cost too much when the school see the scores of the students increase every year.
