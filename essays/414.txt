So, The Filter Bubble Phenomenon is existed on the internet on Google, Facebook, Netflix... etc. its our own personal unique universe of information we live in online.
Whenever we search for something whether on Google or Facebook, later on we will notice some ads that shows up out of nowhere which are concered about what we've searched for before. in other words, The Filter Bubble Isolates you into a bubble that is filled of information and stuff that only you care about and doesn't show you other infortmation about what's happening in the world in general.
"It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.", (Eric Schmidt,Google), this quotation means as Parises said,the internet is showing us what it thinks what we want to see but not neccessarly what we need to see.
in my opinion, The Filter Bubble is a problem, because it depnds on who you are and what you do, also, you don't decide what gets in or even see what gets edited out, thus we only recieve information on what we only search for but not information about any crises that happens here and there.So, us as people we demand some control on what we want to see becasue we do need the internet since it can be a way to connects us all together and to introduce us to new ideas and different prespectives,But, Unfortunately, it won't do that.
To Sum up, The Filter Bubble is bad for us because, it isolates us from the important and keeps us in our own bubble of thoughts and actions which is a very small bubble in a big universe full of infromation and events.
