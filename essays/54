I think, teachers most preferable season is summer; summer stands for summer vacation. The most suitable time for me and my family to travel is in summer vacation. The weather is perfect to swim and practice water activities, especially for my little children. As well, my husband and I prefer to enjoy a sunbath while we have a soft drink. Summer nights are good for staying up and visit friends and relatives, or for be invited in to a family weddings.
