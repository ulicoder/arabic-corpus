M.A. program is a second degree master. Teachers can learn it just after 3 years of teaching experience, it's a rule to participate in it. As it's known most of the student dream to have this program. Unfortunately not all of them can because of the rule which I mentioned previously.
Actually this was one reason of preventing me of learning this program. It was difficult to get a job, but after 6 years of waiting I got a job, when I started my job, one of my goals was that I should keep this job and show to the principle that I'm good teacher to get the opportunity to continue teaching at the same school to have 3 years of experience to enter the MA program.
Addition to the previous reason, I want to accord the power of challenging and learning to my children, to be proud of their mother, as it's know I'm a mother of four children, one of them is a Down syndrome kid, who gives me the efficiency to prove that I'm a good mother for him. I think I'm blessed to have kid like him. In addition to that I would be proud to have mother such mine, she gives me the power to be successful woman, she encouraged me to start learning this year, she is my assistant in keeping my disabled son safe with her.
Finally I expect to succeed in this M.A. program to make my family especially my children and my mother proud of me.
