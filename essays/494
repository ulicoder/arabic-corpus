In my opinion, younger people enjoy life much more than older people do. Young people's passion, pureness, thrive for fun and high energy are enough to help them enjoy their lives and have fun all the time.
First of all, young people don't have a high responsibility compared to older people. For example, older people have responsibility to take care of their children and their homes and earn money for living. These responsibilities reduce the chance of having older people enjoy their lives more, and when they try to do something to enjoy their lives, in the end they prefer their children's happiness first, like traveling, choosing a movie. All these make their lives less enjoyable and fun. However, children are free to choose from a variety of choices to do in in order to enjoy their lives more. For example, they can meet friends, they can go watch a recent good movie, meet other relatives. This shows us how much young people enjoy their lives more than older people do.
In addition, younger people have much more energy and strength in their bodies. On the other hand, as older people grow old they start to have disabilities and body pain form getting tired or being old. This makes their lives less enjoyable and fun as they don't have enough time to think enjoying their time and they only focus on their problems and health conditions.
