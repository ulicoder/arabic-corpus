Spring is my best season. For me, I feel so optimistic when April becomes close. Then everything starts to change in terms of nature and weather.
First, it begins to be warm in which winter clothes and coats can be kept on the shelf: there's no need for heavy and many items to wear.
Second, nature becomes colorful and more beautiful, flowers are blooming, trees are green and the sun is shining.
Also I like picnics and this is the best part of spring. I like to go on picnics with my family or go hiking with my husband or a friend.
I wish spring could stay more than three months or even the whole year - spring is my favorite.
