Regarding the large classes are we teach in, and the number of students in each class, I see it very essential to teach in small number of students in classes, because of my experience, and the way I deal with the situation in everyday life, I will provide an example to show how teaching in small groups of students is more benefit and helpful.
I have a class with 30 students in ti. I truly get exhausted and tired when I teach them, the class is so narrow, the students sit next to each other very closely, things that lead to a mess atmosphere. Then I have to repeat the new teaching material again and again.
But in contrast when I teach private lessons, with 5 students the most, I really enjoy, students get all the things clear, we have much time to concentrate with each student alone and give him the space and the time he need.
I hope that the Ministry of Education will soon be able to change the teaching system, and divide the classes (large classes) into small groups because I believe that this will lead even to a better achievements by students.
