All likes to eat a fast food, and its become a favorite meal, for many peoples. And now we can find it wherever we go. It have a great taste that make you happy, but the question we should to ask, there is a result for this happiness? Recently, in our school there is a suggestion to ban the fast food in it.
This suggestion has an advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages is the fast food has a good taste and many people like it and there is some pupils that eating fast food once of the week. So this suggestion can be harmful to the pupils because they have a freedom to select what to eat.
In the other hand, there is an advantages for the suggestion, because all know the disadvantages of the fast food and how it affected on our body and our health and the school should teach the pupils what good to eat and what's not.
So, in the end, I want to say, that I am with this suggestion because it is help the pupils to stop eating fast food and to save their body.
