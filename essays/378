The filter bubble...
Never heard about it!
Unless you read  about it you will never understand that this is  what is happening with each  one of us.
Actually during my reading  I logged in to my Facebook account and a shopping ad appeared I looked at  the clothes and shopped online.
What I did not notice is that they took all my information and even my credit card without any effort which is something  that I'm going to think twice before sharing it  my in real life.
I continued  with reading and I realized that there is a plan for everything this ad didn’t came out from  nowhere, no, someone knew what is my type what I exactly like and what I want. Whenever we search for something whether on Google or Facebook Netflix  Snapcat Instagram we spread our personal information for free, and we have two sides for this story.
The good side is that we can see what we really like and the  kind of things that we are interested in.
On the other side a lot of personal stuff is out there and I'm sorry but anyone can access it whether by stealing the information or stealing our heads by butting some ads that would lead us to buy things that we don't even need.
So be careful.
