I personally do not like the word literature for different reasons. The first one is that it is a complicated term and it is so difficult to explain it to my student. I hate teaching literature it takes me a lot of effort and time to be well-prepared for my literature classes. The second reason is that nowadays I am taking literature courses and they are so difficult to be understood. I feel lost during these courses. The courses are based on old materials and I don't care about the topics they introduce. Literature is a word that is not from my favorite ones.
