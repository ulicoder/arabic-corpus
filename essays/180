Nowadays, technology has become an important tool, in order to develop the way of life and to enhance the level of living. Technology can be effective and non-effective tool, it could be a distraction if we use it incorrectly correctly. This reflects at the educational field, especially if we don't use technology in a proper way, it could be a wrong and useful way for teaching.
According to Singer and Alexander (2016), the found that students at schools enjoyed using tablets more than the traditional textbooks. However, students learned better when they used print textbooks. So, their learning process was more effective and beneficial, when they sued the traditional text books, because there were less distraction to them, and they used their concentration to do better in their learning.
However, other scholars argued that technology can be an effective tool to use at schools. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), showed in their studies that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional textbooks. Student who used technology and iPads were very engaged at class, they enjoyed learning and playing at the same time. So, students are more engaged with teachers at the classrooms when they use technology and drop the old-fashioned teaching.
