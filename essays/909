Life is based on a series of various decisions that we make seriously and carefully to improve our pattern of life.
Entering the M.A. program was one of the most important decisions I made in my entire life. In my eyes, I entered this program for many reasons. First, studying contributes in gaining more knowledge, more knowledge means more power and more power means more control and confidence. Second, my family was a big support of my decision, they encourage me to enter this program as a way to get ahead in life and to prove my existence as an English coordinator at my school. Thirdly, this program provides me with lots of techniques and strategies that can be so helpful and useful in teaching junior high pupils. Finally, the M.A. program is the first step that leads to satisfaction, success, and progress in life. In addition, it emphasizes my qualification as an English teacher.
My expectations can be varied. I expect a successful and blossomed studying year full of useful and interesting courses. I also expect a year full of enthusiasms and energetic soul. Therefore, I am concern about working under pressure because of the great amount of assessment assignments that I should have. However, I believe that I need to be well prepared and I organized to achieve tasks on time. Also, practice makes perfect.
To sum up, I believe that the key to success is knowledge. Thus, knowledge if power. We need to gain more information to succeed in life and to make lots of progress.
