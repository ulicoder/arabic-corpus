The main reason that makes students love to study and learn and gain knowledge and informations is that the methods that the teacher use with them.
In my opinion I think that the most important thing is the treatment and the connection between the teacher and the students, because when the student is comfortable with the teacher and doing well in the material he gonna loved it and work hard to succeed in his class. Teachers should encourage the students and help them in everything they can't understand or deal with. And to give whatever they needs to do well. thats gonna make the student love the teacher first and respect and trust him, and then he gonna love what he teach him and give him information and gonna love to ask him anything he don't know and will never be shy in front of him. That's how all teachers should treat their students to make them the best.
So, yes I totally agree that the teacher's ability can make anything from his students, it can make them succeed or can make them fall, make them love to learn more, know more, succeed more, work more, it's almost up to the teachers.
It is a serious deal the treat the student gets from a teacher is relate how he gets in his material in class and exams.
