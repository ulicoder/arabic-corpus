School is a place students attend to improve their social skills and acquire knowledge about different fields. However, the process of learning cannot be achieved only in school. Therefore, many teachers claim that giving homework assignments is very important for students to further practice what they learned in class.
Students should practice what they learned because they vary in levels. Heterogeneous classes makes it harder for teachers to help the students reach the same level. Therefore, giving homework allows students to practice more which results them in catching up to their classmates.
Homework should not be too hard for students to do by themselves. Usually, parents help students with their homework however, students should attempt practicing and doing homework by themselves. Therefore, teachers should not give students very difficult homework, that would make them give up and ask for the help of the parents.
In conclusion, homework is very important for students. However, teachers should not give too hard assignments to do.
