No one forget a good teacher it’s: a huge words to say because if you want to reach this great position you have to face a lot and deal with a lot of thing and you must have the good manners to consider yourself the good and great teacher.
When I was a little girl I always heard my family talk about a young guy that teach in the middle school how he behave and the way that he teach in it and the good manner and ethics that he have also I can't forget how the girls were crushed in it because he a really good looking and handsome man, I always looked out to see him teach and want him to teach me after the good compliment that I heard.
Finally this important moment became true I'm now in the middle school and the person that I heard about him my hall life he became my English teacher, and I can't say that their describe was wrong its really true I see him handle with a lot of behaving problems in a fast and considerable and good way, in the exams he know how to pick his questions yes I admitted it’s a hard exams but he was know what our weakness and our strengths, and finally his way in teaching I consider it the perfect way, he was patient with us and if any one don’t understand the methods he repeat one and two and four times and when he teach us he was very comfortable and have a big shiny smile and sometimes he was read a very complicated novels for Shakespeare and let us watch a drama and historical movies to improve our English language to make us love this subject.
And yes this teacher earned the huge words "the great teacher" he makes me love this language and now I prefer to watch two and three American movies in the day because I want to hear them talk in this language and I want to speak like them in a spontaneous way, for the exams I was study a lot and a lot of hours to impress my teacher.
And now I'm an adult and dream to be like him to make every one talk about me in a very beautiful way, I want the student to love me and when they see me they will give a big smile because I'm their good teacher, I want to handle with a lot of generations and make them love the method's and the English language also to make them think about me in a good way that I have to treat them well and be wise with my problems and eventually I want the student to understand that the teacher is not an angle he is just a human try to do his best for them.
