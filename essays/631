First of all‚ I really like the presentation because it a part to prove our personality also the ability to how we will stand front of the class. And I like that the presentation take a part of the final grade and it will be a little bit helpful for us to get a good grade.
I did my presentation with Mays, she is a very nice‚ creative person and I enjoyed that I worked with her.
Our presentation was about a story "The Necklace" it is a very beautiful story talks about dinosaurs and about the future (time machine).
We worked together for the presentation, Mays was a very helpful person and we help each other of course cause the work should divided to pairs.
When we present front of the class I was confused also I was feel like I never to present in a good way like I was prepare in the home‚ I was nervous, when I feel nervous I can't focus well and I was read from the slides‚ maybe if I present again I will not read from the slides because when I read from the slides I can't see who's student's attention is with me.
I want to thank you Miss Jumana for this presentation in this course because it is important to read not just for learning also to ourselves to prove our thinking and language and also it is helpful for us to get a high grade instead of the exam and it takes a little bit time to prepare such as when we study for the exam.
