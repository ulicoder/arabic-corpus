The divine source:
I believe that the divine source theory makes the most sense to me. This theory is about a myth that claims that the original language which was spoken by all people but then they decided to build a tower to reach God and discover the original language, so God punished them by destroying the tower and made them speak more than one language. I believe in this theory because I think that the language is a God - giving gift to human species and that when humans were first created God gifted them with language which explains why animals can not learn our language because God only gifted human kind with it and then when their curiosity got the best of them and they tried to discover the original language by building a high tower ( THE BABEL TOWER) to reach God and discover it he punished them by destroying the tower and making them speak several languages which explains where the other languages appeared from. This theory is believed and mentioned in almost all religions, so if you are a religious person and believe in God and believe that he ia able to do anything then you will not be surprised to know that God created the language. This theory is believable because God has alredy shown us how able he is to create anything he wants so it is natural to come to the conclusion that God who created the whole world in only seven days ia able to create a language. That is how the original language was created and after God's punishment other languages were created. To sum up I believe that the divine source is the only one who makes the most sense in addition, it is also the only theory that discuss and explains why animals did not create a language over the years which is because the gift of language was only gifted to humans.
