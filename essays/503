I do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people. I donâ€™t know what to add here, I will just give the reasons in the paragraphs.
First, young people are always busy running after life demands. They try to be good at studying, and in the same time to earn money. These two needs of a young human need a lot of preparations. While old people do not need to rush to do things, they have time and energy. So they can spend the time on things they like to do.
Secondly, young people are always running to do things at the end of the day, they are not able to do more things. Whereas, older people can wake up in the morning and decide to do an activity that would make them enjoy.
Another reason why younger people do not enjoy life more than older people is that young people are still in the begging of their lived, and they are not aware of the things that make them enjoying. On the other hand, older people know their hobbies and leisure intentionally.
Although, that there are many sayings that claim that older people are not able to enjoy life, because maybe they would be suffering kind of illness or they do not have energy anymore. But this is not right, many evidences prove that many old people go abroad while young people suffers a lack of money or cannot travel because they may have duties at work or assignments to do for college.
At the end, I think older people can spend more time with family, they can be more sociable than younger people because they need to be in duty all time. Older people can do sports more frequent than younger people. Eventually, all these reasons would make younger people's life less enjoyable.
