I would like to describe a nice thing someone did for me. What did my friends for me was a simple but happy me. The thing give me a chance to change my life and he helped me also he give me advice to change my life. The thing was learn me a many things - such as driving, drift, help me, people and others.
I wish to I can help my friends and returned what he service me. If all the people did a nice thing for someone will be better life.
