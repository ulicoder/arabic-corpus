Actually, there are many methods and techniques that teachers use to teach the students, that it is important to know how they must deal with these methods or how to apply them on students on which ways, even if it is the ability to relate well or the knowledge that they should give.
Teachers need to use their ability to relate well with students for some reasons; first, feeling safe at the classroom it's for teacher's responsibility, if a teacher does not deal well with the students it will make them fell disappointed and they will lose their self-confident. Moreover, teachers have to be a friend for the students so they can ask/answer any think they want so they can't feel shy or afraid for the react of the teachers.
On the other hand, the knowledge is something important on our life that we cannot give up. The teacher must have a good and an excellent knowledge to receive that will help us on the future. For example: it is not helpful that a teacher relates well with students and they do not have enough knowledge if it is the way the students will graduate with a self-confident and less knowledge.
To sum up, it is more important we receive knowledge than the teacher's ability to relate well. It more helpful for the future and our career.
