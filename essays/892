We live in a world that is controlled by advanced and highly-complex technological devices. There is no escape from modern advanced technology. It is essential in order to organize our daily lives and activities, however, we need to pay attention to the number of hours we spend working and communicating on these devices.
Youngsters nowadays are the largest group of people who use their smartphones the most, not aware to the fact that this can have a negative effect on them. It can effect their creativity and their interpersonal relationships. When they communicated together, they cannot really know what the others are really telling them because they do not see the gestures or the body language. Body language says much more than words do, and when we communicate over our smartphones we never really know what the others are telling us, or how they really feel. That's why I believe that communicating through computers or smartphones can be bad. On the other hand, for many youngsters communicating through social media can give them the feeling that they are part of the group. It gives them a sense of belonging.
Although I am a conservative person, but I believe that the use of social media is inevitable. We just need to do it in a moderate way.
