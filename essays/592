Me and Hala presented a short story named: "Winter Dreams", wrote by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
The first thing we did was searching about the story through reading the optional stories' names the teacher picked. Finally, we picked "Winter Dreams. Both of us read it, explained it to each other, searched the writer's information, each one prepared her part and lastly we collected everything together and made the power-point presentation.
Reading the story from the first time was not clear, so I had to reread it again. I liked it because it is very close to things we see or live in our everyday lives, it might suit any person on this earth, any couple. It is full of vibes and feelings, good and bad, and about things we can control and others we cannot. I think the most important point that I noticed about myself while preparing to this presentation that I dedicated so much time to make everything clear and easy to understand, this what I do in all of my presentation and every time I hope that I will not feel the fear that I feel each time I present, and really it works; I don't panic and everything gets its way in one way or another.
It was not my perfect presentation; I think I have so much things to improve starting from coming in time. I think that being late took so much effort, it had a large impact on me. If things did not happen that way, I know that I would present it as I planned. For example, I would explain everything I know, I would not read from the slides and I would be careful to have an eye contact with my students. Those are the things that I will work harder on, and I am sure that it will change in the future.
My goals were clear, I wanted to do everything by giving my best. I am aware that I should had missed things and got lost in some point. However, I may have reached some of my main goals in my presentation.
The things that I was not good at I will not repeat, and the good things I will strengthen.
