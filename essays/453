A good teacher is kind.
I think that a good teacher who can give a lot to the pupil and can teach him in a good way and can make the pupil love the subject that he touch it.
If the teacher were a good person with the pupil and kind he can make the pupil love the subject and make the pupil wait his lesson in any moment and if the pupil love the subject he will success.
If the teacher see the love from his pupil toward him he love to give him a lot and a lot and to make his pupil in the high lips (make his a successful persons).
The teacher should be intelligent in a lot of thing for example: in teaching and in way that he prepare his lesson and how he show it for the pupil and how he make the pupil love her lesson and wait it in any moment.
The good teacher should do a lot for his pupil to make him happy when he learn him and not to be a lazy teacher and not to give for him a boring lesson.
Then if the teacher want to be a good should be, have all of this advantage.
