The use of Instagram has become a daily process for most people, with regard to the different ages. People have become so obsessed with it, to the point where they can use non-stop for hours. People who use Instagram normally use it to follow famous people, to see their updated their posts, and to keep track of their daily lives, this results in peoples' dissatisfaction of themselves and their lives. Furthermore, according to Dion (2016), he "found that people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started experiencing a decline in life satisfaction", which is a normal reaction to what takes place on Instagram.
I personally do not use Instagram, just because of the fact that I have seen what it can do to people's life, people are so consumed with it, to the point where they barely actually live a normal life.
