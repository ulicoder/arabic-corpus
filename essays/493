I do agree with this statement, being young is the most exciting thing in life. Many people think that the best stage in life is when you are not young anymore, when you are done with all the "boring" things like studying, attending to school or even living with your parents...
For me things are different being at a young age is something so exciting so fun and so important. The things you do in those years are the things that you are going to remember for the rest of your life, they will be the base of your joy. I am not saying that older people cannot enjoy life, but for sure they donâ€™t enjoy it as much as young people do. When you are young you need to have responsibility, to think a lot, to work hard... But still you have some free time you are wild you are free you are "crazy" you can do whatever you want you are "the king of the world", when you are young you are both a mature and free the things you can do are infinite, it's almost like you have all the time in the world just for you to do whatever you want whenever you want just enjoy it.
Older people do not have much time too many things to do to think about to solve to take care of, it's just an obvious fact being young is something irreplaceable. Let's go to a party, let's have a drink right now, I will stay up late watching a movie or a TV show and I also don't think that I will be awake early either, there is nothing that can prevent you from doing anything you want to do you are free and you will never be young again so enjoy it as much as you can it's now or never.
