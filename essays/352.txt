Today, there are decreasing in the use of calling among the people, instead, they tend to use more texting.
RIT researchers have found that most of the people prefer to have small talk with each other. I think that people tend to use texting more than calling because they don't have time and all the time they are in hurry under a big stress, as a result, they found that texting is more comfortable for both sides the ones who sends the text, and the one who reply to it. I prefer to use the texting most of my time because it is more easier for me. However, I use a phone call just if the issue is very important and I can't wait for others to reply.
I seem, that ten years from now, the number of phone calls will be less than now, because people in these days are disconnected from each other, there is huge gap between them in term of social interaction, they prefer not to call just send a message and that it.
