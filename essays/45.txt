Some people believe homework is important while other do not. I think that homework is important and necessary for the learning process. Homework makes the students review the materials that they studied in school. It also provides them with a chance to practice the skills that they acquired in school.
Therefore, I believe that having homework is important. However, I also believe that students should not be given too much homework, because they should also be allowed some time to rest and play.
