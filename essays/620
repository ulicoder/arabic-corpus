First of all I have to tell how interesting and fruitful the course wasØŒ exposing to short stories by great authors like James Joyce and others made each lesson full of educational and human values like traditions in different nations in different history periods.
I presented about one of James Joyce influential story - Eveline - by reading the story I felt how many details were described accurately. Moreover, the presentation I presented made me feel myself as a good teacher but the feedback I had been given by Dr. Jumana made me feel as an able person, able to be improved and to perform better.
I remember how tens of stories I have read in my life in English both classic and old stories but this course made me looking behind each story and each author. The theme and the feedback of the writer makes a story different tastes and aims not just to improve my English but to discover new traditions and culture, like the story boys and girls it attracts me a lot, the aim and the theme that relates to the woman make it one of my favorite.
during preparing my presentation I read about the author background, I read about the time the story had first published which in 1914 the beginning of WW1, I kept in consideration all these importance moreover.
In every story I would read in my life I will appreciate the background of the writer and the periods the story was written at, I do know how much it is important to make some events clear and to understand the conflicts easier.
