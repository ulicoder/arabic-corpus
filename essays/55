Evaluation is both important for students and for teachers. When students evaluate the teacher's methods of teaching, they would become an efficient part in the learning process. Sharing a part in the learning process raises their motivation and increases the teaching level. Students can be close to their teacher by encouraging the good points in the lesson. On the other hand, the teacher can be closer to the pupils' world, when they interfere in the learning process and share their thoughts safely and express their bad feeling upon the lesson. Consequently, both can figure out the most suitable ways of teaching that fit both parties, students and teacher.
