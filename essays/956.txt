In recent years, we saw the arrival of the new devices and long with the came of cellphones and smart phones, we as teachers claimed that it would be revolutionize for our students, even if they use it as educational tools or for learning purposes.
According to the survey conducted by Tinder and Bohlander (2011), 95% of the students bring their phone to class every day, and 92% use their phone to text message during class time. The majority of the students also admitted they used their phones for browsing, sending pictures and accessing social networks during classes.
This survey has shown that using cellphones during lessons cause damage for our students, because they invest their time by using their phones and browsing and sending pictures, and the result for that, they lose concentration and forget what I have told them to do.
A study by Lee, Kim, McDonough, Mendoza and Kim (2017) conducted an experiment in which students were divided into three groups: cellphone usage allowed, cellphone possession allowed but without usage, cell phones removed. All participants attended a 20-minute lecture and were sent text messages during the lecture to mimic classroom distractions. After the lecture, all three groups took a multiple-choice test on the material they learned. The participants who had their cellphone taken away performed significantly better on the test than the two other group.
This study has investigated the negative impact of using cellphones during the lessons or test, is surely right, and I agree with this view because there is no need for using cellphones during lessons it is better for them and better for their health.
