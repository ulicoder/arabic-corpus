The filter bubble is talking about  information are hidden by the websites for many reason one is for protecting, and for political reasons.
A lot of websites have private information about you and you don't know that, the datas which are known for most common and used websites that attract you easily and let to use their pages for a very low hours daily, and sometimes it could be the same pages that are used by you and your neighbors but they have a different contents and different subjects, it all depends  what attracts each person.
In my perspective I think that the filter bubble is bad to us but in other hand it is good because it protects a very private information for any user or any information related to political issues in the country.
In  the contrary it  is bad because it  does allow you to access for any page or website that you need or seeing your friend's picture to make sure of the owner of the page which has his / her name.
