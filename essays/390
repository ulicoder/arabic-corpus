"I Tried A Korean Skin Care Routine For A Month And This Is What Happened".
In this article a woman who is called Essence tried a Korean skin care regimen for a whole month. In addition, she uploaded pictures she took every week of this month in order to show us the differences that occurred to her face between one week and the next.
This article is mainly aimed for teenagers and twenties, because she tells us her experience and what happened to her skin during her period, and only young girls and women get period. So by this we can infer that the article is directed to the young aged population. And in most of the cases where women get pimples on their face they are not old women.
In addition to the audience that the article was directed to, Essence used informal language, and we can infer that by the following  phrases – "what the heck" and "what's up y'all". We can’t use these phrases in formal articles.
K-beauty: The rise of Korean make-up in the West.
In this article you can't find informal words or phrases like in the previous article "I Tried a Korean Skin Care Routine for a Month and this is what Happened". Instead they used the formal tone.
Furthermore, this article is suitable for all genders as one, meaning it is pointed for both women and men,  because it talks about a trend that is rising in the West. So it's not specifically for one kind of gender.
In summary, in both of the articles "K-beauty: The rise of Korean make-up in the West" and "I Tried a Korean Skin Care Routine for a Month and this is what Happened", the tone and the audience are not the same, as I mentioned earlier.
