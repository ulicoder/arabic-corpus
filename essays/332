In recent years, technology has been prevalent. Therefore, many schools have started using tablets instead of print textbooks.
In general, students like to use smart devices because it is more enjoyable due to the fact that one can watch videos, see pictures or listen to audios. This advantage can encourage the students to participate in classes and feel motivated to learn.
Even though that students like using tablets, Singer and Alexander (2016) found that students learned better when they used print textbooks. So it seems that students may not learn better when they use tablets because maybe they are surfing the Internet or they are sending messages to each other.
However the above (aforehand) research found that students did not learn better when they used tablets, another research by Harcourt (2011) opposes it. The study showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional textbook. So, it can be seen that using tablets can be helpful to students and advances their learning process. Therefore, schools should think start to integrate using tablets during lessons.
In the end, although there may be some difficulties adapting the use of tablets in lessons, based of what Singer and Alexander (2016) found, I suppose that using tablets can contribute tremendously to the learning process.
