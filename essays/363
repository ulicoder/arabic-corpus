After I read the three articles I want to summarize the three ideas in this blog .
first I really enjoyed reading about clean eating because we need to be aware about the importance of eating clean and healthy because  it can improve our lifestyle.
certainly I have heard about the term "clean eating" it is common nowadays also I'm following a healthy lifestyle, so why it's common?! as we all know and with the awareness of healthy lifestyles has increased among people due of frequent use of social media, through which they witness and learn the advantages of healthy living, approximately everyone now knows what is healthy for his body and what is not, for example in what social media can affect on people  the blogger which mentioned in one of the articles by "Bee Wilson", the blogger was having a great influence on her 40,000 follower and all or some them were following her idea of clean eating.
from my point of view clean eating become a lifestyle not a phenomenon, and it should be mandatory for each person. in the three articles I learned three different points related to clean eating, two of them are showing us how sometimes clean eating may be harmful if we use it in a wrong way, but each article presenting this idea in a different way and the third one was the most enjoyable to me which giving 12 way to eat in a clean and healthy way also it was the most beneficial article, which I will follow it in my healthy lifestyle.
