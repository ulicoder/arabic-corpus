Pupils learn many things from their parents, relatives, environment as well as school. Students learn from each other bad words and start to use it at home and at school. As an educator and a class teacher I ask my students not to say these words, because they reflect a negative image of the student himself. It is also considered as a verbal violence, which is totally unacceptable in my classrooms.
Personally, as a teacher I punish every student utters such bad words because it is immoral and unacceptable.
