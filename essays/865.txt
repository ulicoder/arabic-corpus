According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, women earned just 18% of computer science degrees. Analysts actually claim that the reason behind this is because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically, on one hand. Psychologists, on the other hand, claim that this decline might partly be attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals, where male are portrayed as scientists. With regard to the perspectives above, I back the idea that women are not encouraged to pursue science, and society does not often encourage women to enter such spheres. This is referred to many reasons.
Firstly, having less women in the sphere of technology, refers to a cultural issues and norms. Society, for example, forms opinions regarding what is boy's career and women's. In schools, as well, teachers start teaching girls in a very young age what is the best career for them. As a result, women become into realization that they are not equal to boys indeed even in choosing a career for their future.
Socially, working in the technology sphere is meant to be for men only, since it requires long hours of work. Thus, women might not be interested in working in such fields, since they might be moving toward longer maternity and stay for a long period of time with their children. They might, actually, prefer to have a career with a short working hours in order to spend much time with their families.
Besides, the media plays a significant role in portraying males as scientists and not women. In the Western media, movies and TVs, for instance, male are portrayed as scientist and not women. This is actually has a bad affect on women's career choice.
To sum up, as mentioned, the misconception about computer science among women hasn't actually changed and, nowadays, women still do not work in the realm and sphere of technology.
