Homework is very important to evaluate students. i think giving homework it's like restoration the material, also to give the students motive to keep reading and be ready for next lesson.
Homework can helps students develop good study and learning habits that are important as they progress through the grades.
Also, homework can helps students to practice skills and strategies and to review information that has been taught in class. However, teachers should take into consideration the student situation and they should not give them a huge homework or complicated one. That make students scream from schools and came upset. Also a key purpose of homework is to build communication between the students and the parents.
At the end, I really think they keep giving homework because homework is an integral part of learning, yet students and parents both often feel as though too much homework is being assigned or that the work assigned is not benefitting the students learning experience.
