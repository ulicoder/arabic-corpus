In those days students use many unliked words among each other in their own language. So it is not acceptable for me, because they have to respect me and each other.
Furthermore, this bad words that some students use reflect the family education (culture). If a student comes from a respectable family, he will not use bad words.
In this case, if I hear one student say an unrespectable word, I try to tell him that he reflects his family, so he will be so shy and will not repeat it again.
