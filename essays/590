I think that the teacher's ability to relate well with students and excellent knowledge of the subject, are both important in order to complete the teacher's job to the fullest.
I mean, that it's not enough only to relate well with students without having excellent knowledge of the subject, and the same thing, it doesn't work only to know the subject very well without having a way to relate well with students.
Because in one hand, it is understood implicitly that teachers must know the subject that they would teach it very well, in order to cover all the material and to give sufficient information to their students, but in other hand they can't teach students without having specific way for that.
I think that it is very important to know how to relate with students, to have a way to understand each other, and to communicate because if we don't have this connect with our students then they will not be attractive to the lessons and the material, therefore they will not be serious with our teaching, so they will not look for success in this material.
I believe that the first step to teach students it's to make them feel interest in the subject so they will look for knowing more about it. It's up to our ways as teachers of showing the subject, even if it bored but we can make it more interesting if we success it together in some different ways.
I think that teacher's job is including besides of teaching students, another things such as: listen to them, to their problems and to help them solve it, to answer their questions and to make them feel better, and the most important thing is to make them believe in their self and their abilities.
If teachers successes to make this connect with their students then they will can teach them even make their lessons more interesting.
