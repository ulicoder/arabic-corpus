Good teachers know how to bring out the best in their students.
As children develop from age to age, they get their courage that they need from their parents until the age that they go to school.
When children start school they would meet new kids new people and new important person that needs to be on the top of the list and we call it a "Teacher".
A teacher is the main person in a child's life every teacher needs to have a way to show the love and the courage for every student.
One of the important things that teachers need to learn is how to bring out the best in every student.
There are many ways in my mind that a teacher can bring the best in her student. First, to begin with a teacher needs to be very close to her students so the student would feel the love that the teacher is giving.
Second, a teacher should do an activity that will encourage every child to show his or her talent.
Third, a teacher should encourage her students to continue with their best thing, also a teacher needs to be there to support her students in there ups and downs.
Now some students might be amazing in English and some might not be very well but they might be amazing in Arabic every person has his good and not so well subject or thing, every teacher in her job needs to show the support that needed that a student might not get from home.
I think this is an important way to bring out the best in our students therefor I would use this method in the future and I encourage every teacher to try it.
