Now we live in a very developed world that uses many developed tools that help us to live more comfortable. For example people used to communicate with their friends and family through letter and phone calls, but nowadays they have many ways of communication that is easier for them. Instead of calling someone to tell him something and hang up now we can send a message on the mobile using many apps, using text messages instead of calling because it is more comfortable way, you can text them when you can and they can text you back when they are free. You will not embarrass yourself calling someone in an appropriate time to ask or tell something quickly.
So using apps like Whatsapp make our life easier and better, it gives us more privacy in personal life. I think everyone should start using text messages more than calling people.
