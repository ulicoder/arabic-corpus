I don't agree that students can evaluate their teachers well.
Actually, it happened to me three years ago when I was teaching in an elementary school. The students were not able to evaluate the whole year but the last lesson they learned in school.
In addition, I believe that students do not know what the best for their future since they are still kids. They prefer to run, sing, play and enjoy rather to study well. So, they can not choose the best teachers for them.
I think it depends on the students age. For example, pupils at the third grades cannot decide if their teachers are good or not. They will indicate for teacher whom they love.
In another words, pupils will talk about their feelings toward their teachers. And they will not deal with other criteria like: knowledge, profession and personality. Whereas, we have to listen for them in order to take some information, they may be helpful.
