Air conditioners are widely used in the summer, as people tend to use it more because of the hot weather. People who use air conditioners tend to enjoy the low temperature, which is not always healthy to many people, especially the ones who work in offices and stores. Furthermore, Hedge and Gaygen (2010) support this by claiming "that the optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that". Which indicates that air conditioning can cause harm as much as it can cause good.
Opposingly, others claim that in places of work, or malls, the lower the temperatures are in these places the fancier it is.
Murphy (2015) "writes that being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. Luxury stores often maintain colder temperatures than mass-market stores."
Which is rather nonsensical, how can low temperature reflect power and prestige. The use of air conditioning is often unimportant, people do not pay attention to its advantages and disadvantages, which explains why they do not know how to handle the temperature.
From a personal experience the disadvantages of air conditioning outweighs its advantages, that is because not only does it distract people when working but it affects their health as well, if not used properly it can result in catching a cold, or various lung diseases.
