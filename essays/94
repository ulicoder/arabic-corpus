Personally, I think that it is a good idea to ask the students to evaluate their teachers in an objective way, they can express how do they feel toward a specific teacher and mention all the positive things that they like in his lesson and also they can mention the negative things that they would like their teacher to change or to improve.
It is not necessary that a bad feedback about one teacher makes this teacher a failure in his work, he should take every comment into consideration and try to improve himself in a positive way and also to improve his teaching skills and his teaching materials. Those feedback are also a way to create a dialogue between teachers and students.
In addition, I think that students should have the right to criticize both the content and the methods of teaching. In the future, those students will be good self-critics and they will be able to improve themselves.
