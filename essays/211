Nowadays, most of our communication is done through technological devices, especially smartphones. people usually use phone calls and texting. The number of these phone calls and text messages differ from one to another. Personally, I use texting much more than phone calls and I think that most of people are the same. Texting saves time, and offers us the opportunity not to reply immediately.
Both phone calls and texting have benefits and disadvantages, still, texting seems more comfortable. It also can deliver the message with less time and more direct. In the future, I believe that the number of the phone calls will be less than it is now.
