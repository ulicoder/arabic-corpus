All of the three articles talked about one subject,Instagram, but from different aspects, and the audience of it were not the same.
I found this article "How Influencers Build Instagram Followings" the most interesting one; I learned that it is not that easy to be an influencer on Instagram because you have to upload a lot of things every day even when you're not in the mood, and have to upload only things that interests everyone, because if not you may lose followers. In addition, I found it the most researched and presenting the best evidence and it contained documentary evidence.
