This is my first time presenting a short story, and it was very exciting and different from other presentations when we were required to present an article, presenting a short story is very enjoyable because you go through many stages, from reading a new story, and learning about the author of this story, also you have to apply your knowledge in literature to write the literary devices in this story, and to write the Freytag's Pyramid. Moreover, you have to analyze the story which can get you to a fictional journey.
Therefore, This experience will defiantly help me a lot in my future studies, because in the coming three years we will have literature courses and we will be obliged to read and analyze and to present stories, and now we know how to do it.
In the beginning I was nervous when you told us that we have to present a short story. However, once Ghazaleh and I started preparing and reading, we did not have much difficulties. It was also my first time partnering with Ghazaleh, I never presented with her before, this was also one of the reasons I was anxious, but she was actually a great partner; we did not have difficult time working together, in contrast, it was a good experience that I will doubtless do again. We completed each other during the presentation and we had a good consistency.
In the future, I will probably plan another fun activity to get the students more active during the presentation. I love doing activities, but I did not have much time to create more.
