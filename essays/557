I agree with this statement because the attitude and the relation between the teachers and their students are important if the teacher improve the relation thats will be so helpfull for the students to love the teacher, the subject, the school and thats will be fine for the class.
For me personaly when I was a student I focus on the treatment of the teachers if they treat me ok i will love the subject.
I choose to be an English teacher because when I was in junior high school the teacher who learn me this subject make me like the subject in many different ways:
First she was came with her a game and the game has a goal we must to find and reach to the goal.
Second she was help us to understand the stories that she learn as and many things.
Third his treatment was so amazing that make us love the lesson more.
I wish that I will be just like her to help the students to over come the hard ways to be a successful students.
That is all what I have I wish that will like you.
