Some people believe getting a homework is important and necessary for kids. I against the homeworks for many reasons. First, the kids want to play, to rest, to eat, and to sit with their families. Wherefore, the kids have the right to feel free not to feel stress. Second, why did the teachers give the homework for the kids? If they want to know that the pupils understand the lesson, they have to check that during the lesson. Since children don't care for the homework.
Finally, the parents need to sit with their children after the school. I ask my kids about their day (how do they feel? What bothers you in your day?) I prefer to make this conversation with them, because it is better more than to doing their homework.
