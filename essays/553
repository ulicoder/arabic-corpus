I agree with the ability of the teacher that he/she relate with his/her students because the teacher is the hero for their students like they can learn from him/her and he/she will help to solve their problem and to help them as possible they can and I'm sure that the students will feel so much comfortable that they have a teacher how can understand them and the students can ask their teacher whatever they want and they will give them the advices that will makes them take the correct way. The students will love the teacher according to him/his way in teaching because some of the students hate the lesson because of their teacher they can't reach to the correct method because some teacher they can't be responsible person on the class and don't have a good way to make them love the method. On the other hand we have a lot of teachers that's makes you love their lesson because the way they teach and because of that I'm here one of my favorite teachers she makes me fall in love with the English language in junior high I'm really thankful that she learn me.
