I would like to describe about you a nice thing that someone did for me. My friend call Ahmad we are friends about 10 years. Her dad work a teacher and her mother works a doctor, and his family are very rich. In one day I wanted a 1000 Dollars, and no one can give me, I was very tired and donâ€™t have what to do, suddenly I remember my friend, Ahmad, I called to him and said that I need 1000 Dollars, he accept and give me. I was very happy, and I thanks him.
