Everyone should work in a job and a place they like and prefer to be in.
It is not fun to work at a place or in a job you hate because you will not fulfil yourself in it.
I want to be a game designer because I like playing games and I am amazed by how good games â€“ I dream of working in this job because I get to design games and that is what I like.
