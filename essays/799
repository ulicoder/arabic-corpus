the genetic source / the genetic mutation ,
this theory is the most relevant in my opinion, because I think that it makes more logic explanation, however all other animals can communicate with signs, with some tools that they developed over the years, but they could not develop a words like us, maybe sounds. but we have some gene that explain our ability to create a language and to communicate with different languages in different ears in the world.
as we can notes that the babies born with the an innate capacity to learn language by hearing it , instead the babies that born deft can not develop this property because they did nor hear the language so they use the sign language , even according to many theories the babies before they get birth they learn the language because they hear the talking.
They consider this ability as a mutation, because other animals like apes has the same structure of the hemispheres but they could not through the years to develop this ability instead then could to develop an abilities to communicate with each other even with other species but not the Â ability to create a language. so the people who work on explaining this different consider it as a mutation or we can said a lack on gene that create our ability to talk and communicate with language.
