I actually agree with this statement. That a teacher's relationship with the students is more important than the information or the subject is being taught.
Even if a teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject which she or he is teaching it would be for nothing if the student can't understand the subject. This happens when the teacher does not relate with students, and try to know if they understand what is being taught to them. I remember my physics classes when I was in eighth grade, our teacher had a good knowledge and used to solve every problem related to physics from any book. But I never understood the lectures in that subject and was very weak in it. And I actually remember barely getting through that class, didn’t fail, but I passed. Barely.
Knowledge is not gained only from material taught in class but also from experiences of life. If the teacher has good a relationship with the students all their past experiences can be shared with them and give them a practical knowledge of life. This helps the student to face their problems in their own lives. My English teacher always shared her experiences like how hard she worked to get a job, and that she never turned back even at tough times when she had less money, tried again and again until she finally got the job she loved to do.
Also, understanding and engaging, as in relating to students, are two of the many other qualities of a good teacher. A teacher should relate to students in terms of, say like a student with who can't didn’t understand a certain point, didn’t do something that is required but actually has a good reason for not doing it, also, an understanding teacher would actually encourage students to engage and participate more.
