It is known that a teacher plays a significant rule in shaping the students' personality and life. One may think that the teacher's excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than his/her ability to relate well with students, while others think the opposite. I believe that the teacher's ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge.
When a teacher does not relate to the students, his/her excellent knowledge of the subject being taught will go vain because students will not be able to understand what the teacher is explaining.
Moreover, knowledge is not only gained in school or college it could be gained in life, and life's knowledge, in my personal opinion, is more important than school knowledge because life's knowledge comes out of experiences. therefore, teachers also should be talking about their experience in life not to be only concerned with giving materials.
To conclude, a teacher should have knowledge and and ability to relate well with the students.
