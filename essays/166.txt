Actually, I enjoy watching the season change around the year. However, my favorite season is summer. I think that this season gives me a lot of energy because I like air-conditioning atmosphere it makes me feel relax and comfort.
In addition, summer is the season of the long vacation, so I can spend a lot of time with m family and we can have fun in the beach. It is so amusing in summer.
On the other hand, my least favorite season is autumn. This season makes me depressed all the time, I don't know why (maybe, it's a psychological thing). Furthermore, the weather is not known, each separate day differ, so it is hard to take a decision: where to go, what to wear or what to do.
