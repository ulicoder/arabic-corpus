I believe we can all agree that young people are more energetic there for they are able to do more, and the more they get old the less they do, but does more doing really means more joy?
In every stage of one's life there are advantages and disadvantages. For most young people physical problems aren't an obstacle. They can travel, go to a party, or maybe go for a swim. However, there is many others that could get in the way, such as money, time and other commitments that would prevent young form having all the fun they want.
And if we look at the life of an old man we would see how actions that require a lot of physical activities arenâ€™t the only way to get joy. By absorbing his life, we are able to get an idea of the peace he is mostly living in, he's in a kind of a harmony with nature and his surroundings.
I see old people as people who has reached a curtain point in their lives where they can sit and look back for all what they have achieved, all the things they were able to enjoy while they were young and all the memories they have and just stay in the peace they have created for themselves. And I truly believe that with both; the peace they're living in and memories they have on their minds they're able to enjoy every single moment and the point they have reached helps them to give more value to each moment that is passing.
The good thing is that for most people they get to live and experience life in every stage and get the most out of it. We will experience both being young and old and who knows maybe I'll change my mind when I'm seventy.
