Air conditioning is used today more than ever. It is used in stores, offices, classrooms and even at home but sometimes it is overused in some cases. When we walk in a store and we feel very cold we should have the opportunity to say that it is very cold here and they should turn it off. Unfortunately we as customers don't have that option so if we are cold we need to try and maintain this coldness until we leave the store.
Does this mean that if the store is colder in the summer that it has more prestige. According to Murphy (2015) being able to make people feel cold in the summer is the sign of power and prestige. On that contrary to Murphy's saying people have air conditioning at home and they can feel colder than ever, so really this does not have any power or prestige.
