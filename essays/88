Paper books are considered to be better than e-books. According to a research done by PWC Consulting (2019), e-books were used more than print books in US and UK. People who prefers e-books find in easier to read and to get the material with no need to buy and pay for books.
Besides, they think about it in terms of environment and how to support the idea of recycling. Another research was done by Helm, Ligon, Stovall, and Van Riper (2018). Students from US college participated in the research and preferred paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provide; emotionally, they like to touch and smell the book itself.
I think that e-books are better used than paper books for different reason.
First, in terms of environment, we have to reduce the usage of paper and try not to harm the environment.
Second, it is more practical to find material and book using the computer, especially, all kinds of book are available with no need to pay for books.
In conclusion, it is obvious that both researches can be convinced by many people.
