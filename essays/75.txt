Our students struggle to wake up in the morning so early, and may it is the reason behind why are they lazy and sleepy.
Sleep less than 8 hours per night could be considered detrimental to their health, and when they in a rush to get school so they will not eat a healthy breakfast before they came. I think it is the biggest issues that our students face in the morning and put more pressure for them and on the morning routine for parents.
