Many cities begun banning cars from entering the city center. As a result, there is a worry about the influence of this phenomenon on people. I am completly in support of this.
First of all, if the cars enter the city center, they will cause a traffic jam. For example, people who live in the city center will be late for their work and they will face many problems. Conseqently, the traffic jam will increase the level of the air pollution which will affect the people's health.
Secondly, banning cars from entering the city center might affects the commercial shops, because people will find difficult to come by the public transportation, so they will not prefer to come to the city center. As a result, the percentage of sales will be depreciated.
In conclusion, all the cities must enact this low and take care of city center so that reduce air pollution. I prefer that the cities do this.
