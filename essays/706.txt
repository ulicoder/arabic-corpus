Nowdays, many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center because of the huge number of cars on the streets and the annoynse. So I totaly agree with banning cars from entering the city center.
On the one hand, if the cities start banning cars from entering the center of the city, people will use public transportation more, which will make human's life much easier. Moreover, using cars will cause air pollution to our environment which causing much damages to citizens, such as helth issues.
On the other hand, using public transportation probably be an obstacle for some people. For example, person who wants to do somthing important in the city center, using public transportation like bus might banning him from reaching the city center at the required time, that's because the specific times for a public transport.
In conclusion, due to the pollution and annoynce caused by cars in the city center, it is better to go by public transport. Although there are only limited times for public transport, it's redusces the traffic crises.
