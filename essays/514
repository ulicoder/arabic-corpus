Who enjoys life more? Older people or younger people? In order to enjoy life a person must be burden-free to certain of things and don’t have responsibilities, enthusiasm, full of energy and this characterized young people not older people. This I am going to illustrate and support in the following paragraphs.
Being in shape, grace, healthy and sick-free from disorders allows young people to be more enjoyable to do sports that older people cannot do for example: sky diver (jumping from a height an airplane reaches in sky is not recommended to older people with heart diseases) as a result it is not enjoyable to have a life when there are multi of things that you cannot do, this reflect on older people that they have a range in the things they can do because of their health also having headaches and back pains that are ironically come with old people not young people.
Young people have energy and enthusiasm that make them live life like it is their last day to breath. In addition, young people appreciate little things that consider childish in the older people perspective and point of view on the matter.
Not having jobs and worries on the money and to financial family and provide food like older people do, makes them do the same routine over and over which can lead to make life less enjoyable However younger people do not do that and they don’t have obligates and mandatory things to do in life which make them enjoy life and make it simpler.
