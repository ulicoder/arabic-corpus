According to a study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), the scores of students who used iPads in math increase 20% in one year comparing to students using traditional textbooks, I encountered that it is very useful to use iPads in the learning process for many reasons. First, when the student writes on the textbook, parents must buy a new book for their other children, thus it would cost them a lot of money each year. Second, iPads are ecological friendly, when students use iPads, the world saves a great amount of paper. Third, according to another study, by Singer and Alexander (2016) pupils enjoyed learning by tablets more than print textbooks, therefore using tabletes in classrooms would be enjoyable thus as a teacher I would mix the two methods in my teaching progress. I can use both strategies. I can give students worksheets in order to write and give them tasks to perform on tablet or iPad.
Finally, I, as a teacher, want my students to succeed and have great grades together with that I want them to enjoy the lesson, moreover to have good experiences in their learning process, thus I need to use many different strategies in my class. Therefore I can use both technology such as tablets, computers or iPads, in addition I can teach according to the traditional methods.
