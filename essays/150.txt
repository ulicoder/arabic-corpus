My favorite season is summer. This season is very comfortable for all: kids and adults. It is the perfect atmosphere to do many different outdoors activites, such as BBQ parties, swimng in the sea and gong parks. As a parent, I dont have to worry about getting my childern flu from the bad weather. When the summer starts, the sun sets latly and you have a long time to do whatever you want withuot worrying about sunsete. Also, the important thing is the two months summer vacatone.
