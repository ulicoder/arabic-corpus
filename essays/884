Women and girls are not pursuing careers in computing and tech fields for many reasons. First, girls are raised differently. They choose their own toys and future jobs at early age based on how they were raised. Thus parents are the root of the problem. Parents should encourage their girls to pursue careers in computing and exposed them to the reason or purpose of why they need to compute in the first place.
Second, teachers at school need to raise awareness over the job possibilities for both genders, girls and boys equally. According to the National Center of Women, girls are not encouraged to pursue science as boys. Moreover, the source of the problem can be represented by the teachers perspectives. Consequently, teachers should always encourage girls to take challenges and follow their dreams, no matter what profession they get in the future. Thirdly, the education system that is related directly to the community should be improved and changed to allow girls and women to take part in technology fields. Our society should use its highest potential to close the gap between women and men in pursuing careers in technology fields.
Finally, technology can be fun and challenging. Moreover, girls and women can gain more confidence if they are involved in such careers. However, we were used to see males mastering movies and TV screens over women in terms of technology uses. What I just suggest come from the academic research based on Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor.
To sum up, as mentioned above a good community should do its best to close the gap between both genders, since girls and women have abilities to make a difference in this society in case they are engaged fully in the real world of technology. That is why I believe we need to attract more women in technology classes to achieve and contribute to to society in depth. So the low number of women working in tech fields can be increased.
