In my opinion, the is not better to start our day in school at 10:00 o'clock. God create the day and the night. God made the night to sleep and made the day to do our workers. So, I prefer to begin our day at 8:00 o'clock to be as teachers and students more creative and full of energy. I am sure if the students stay at home at 10:00 o'clock, they will be sleep and they will be lazy to come to school. By the way what about the parents if they go to their work, who send their children to school, how do they let them at home alone. I think that is more useful for me as a woman worker to send my children to school at 8:00 o'clock.
