In my opinion, I think that single-sex school is not a good idea, and it has disadvantages for two reasons. First reason is that single-sex school doesn't create an atmosphere of participation and competition between boys and girls, which can help them learn from each other.
Second reason, single-sex schools is reduce the chances of active learning, decrease the sense of creativity of the students, and doesn't allow both girls and boys to know more about their way of thinking.
I think that one of the most important factors of creative and successful students is participation and competition in classes. So I think the interaction between boys and girls during the lessons is the main factor that makes them learn and know each other. In addition being in the same place together boys and girls that help them to communicate with each other. Both genders will try to prove to the other one that they are better and know more and this situation will create kind of competition and creativity during the lesson.
