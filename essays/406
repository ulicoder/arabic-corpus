The filter bubble is a complex and incredible phenomenon, it's talking about how much social media is apparently shaping how we understand the world around us.
How the websites can use our information and interests and our personalization to control what we will encounter online.
We think that we see is all there is without realizing that what we see is being filtered and without to know that our privacy has been sacrificed for the sake of advertising revenue.
As a result, we will increasingly each live in our own, we can receive mainly ads and mainly news that is familiar and confirms our beliefs.
For the first time, I read the article of filter bubble I was in shock how the technology can be controls us how it can formulate what we can see and what can across.
Anyhow it's a positive way to encounter the most interesting things we searching for without bothering, but in the other hand, it reveals how personalization could undermine the internet’s original purpose.
