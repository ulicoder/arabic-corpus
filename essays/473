To be a teacher is not just to teach or to give the students what they need, no it's totally not like that being a teacher is being a sister or sometimes a mother to your students so then the students will not forget you and they will feel save when you talk to them and maybe they will tell you a things that really bothered them and they can't tell anyone except you. I mean the teacher had a big rule in the student life and she can affect his life easily... If she teach in love and also give the class a entertaining things like if she teach a Arabic subject for example, when they reading a poem you can listen to it across a singers that sing it so it wouldn’t be boring for them, when the teacher does this in all the subjects not just to pass the forty five minutes the student will be just want to repeat these seconds so therefore he will be enthusiasm for the class and after that you can fell the changing in his grades and that is the purpose of "good teacher know how to bring out the best in their students", so maybe there is another sides for this sentence like in the behavior of the student when he is a aggressive student you need to know how to deal with him like what I said before to be a friend to him because absolutely he is basing in a difficult circumstances, and really no one forget a good teacher…
