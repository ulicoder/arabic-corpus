The main reason behind the low numbers of women earned just 18% of computer science degrees are partly because girls and women are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys, so I think teachers and parents have a large influence on students / kids decision to study computer science. Therefore, it is important for girls to be exposed to computers at young age, and we can present to them shows and movies that show successful scientists women, in this we encourage and support them to enter to this field.
