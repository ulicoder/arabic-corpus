In an era where social media takes over a large part of people's life, regardless of their age or profession, it is no surprise that one of these social media tools, Instagram, have became the focus and the concern of many, leading to an unhealthy obsession with different superficial aspects of life.
On the one hand, a study by Dion (2016), the use of Instagram, following many celebrities, leads to a decline in the level of life satisfaction one may feel, as the extravagant lifestyles of these celebrities may stir up negative emotions in the person towards herself, leading to negative thinking and eventually a decline in self-confidence and self-esteem.
On the other hand, in a study by Sheldon and Bryant (2016), there are positive factors of the use of Instagram, as the survey conducted on 239 college students showed that creativity and documentation of life events and memories made up a significant part of the lean towards using Instagram which may positively reflect on their lives.
In conclusion, Instagram and any other mean of social media, when used wisely and with moderation, can contribute with positive aspects to a person's life.
