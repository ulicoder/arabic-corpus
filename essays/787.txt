According to Singer and Alexander (2016) who found that students enjoyed using tablets more than print textbooks but learned better when they used print text books.
I am totaly agreed with their results of using the tablates, student enjoy because the think if we have a technology lesson they will not learn, they think its just for fun as wasting time. In addition to what I mentioned before, student connect that the textbooks in front of them is the only way to learn, however, it's not true in my opinion. we as a teachers should aware the students about the new or modiren way of teaching and learning.
In my point of view technology is invading the education field at an increasing pace. Using technology served in good ways to be a smart student these days, they could have direct communication with their teachers, there are easier to use in learning, students can improve computer skills, the students also have paperless homework. Based on another research which was by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011), who showed that students using iPads saw their math test scores increase 20% in one year compared to students using traditional text books so its a good way to get better in math especially for student who have math problems can learn in enjoyable way to understand the materials.
Finally I see that using tablets instead of textbook is better. iPads are lightly than heavy books, students can replace books with iPads. The technology is a modern and enjoyable way to learn these days.
