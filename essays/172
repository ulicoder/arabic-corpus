In the last 10 years e-books became very popular. People start to read and use book from the internet even without printing it. They read it from the computer. Personally, I prefer to read paper books for many reasons. First, it is more comfortable for my eyes to read from paper books and so I can add my notes and mark important sentences or material that I want to remember.
Most people prefer to use e-book from the standpoint of maintaining the environment. That is according to the study in 2018, PWC Consulting found that in 2018, e-book sales were higher than print book sales in US and UK. So people start to get used to e-books and prefer it more than print books.
On the other hand, some students prefer paper books because of the tactile and olfactory experience they provided, Helm, Ligon, Stovall and Pipe (2018) made a study and proved that students prefer printed books.
In conclusion, some people prefer to use paper books and some prefer e-books it relates to each person and his personality and his desire. personally I prefer paper books.
