We are in a generation that can do a lot with their cellphones. Phone calls are becoming less used with the presence of text messages since people hate small talk. What people need in this fast-paced life is an instant and immediate reply without introductions.
I personally hate using text messages because they are empty of feelings and can be misinterpreted sometimes. In addition, the receiver of the message can postpone replying to it; therefore to call and get a response can save time and effort of checking the cellphone. I think in ten years from now, people will realize the importance of phone calls and use them more than now.
