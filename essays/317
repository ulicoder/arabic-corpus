Pokémon Go game is based on the famous Japanese anime television miniseries. Pokémon Go game is a game that can be download as an app via smartphones.
According to the article the Pokémon Go game is positive and goo for the brain, today's kids are prisoned by their smartphones that they do not go out outside and play outside and stimulate the brain to work and function as it should be. In addition, it could be a well excuse to workout and chase the Pokémon, therefore it can be good for the health.
However, as someone who was obsessed with Pokémon Go game, and almost got hit by a car, I think it is solely an excuse to people who are playing this game to stare at their phones and tuning out from the rest of the world. The time I almost got hit by a car while playing this game and searching and chasing the Pokémon to capture it and win the next level, is the day I realized how dangerous this game is and how it is consuming me and taking away all of my sight for the surroundings. I am simply prisoned to my iPhone screen that I did not pay attention to the street and that the light was red.
In Conclusion, although The New York times did provide a positive feedback regarding the game and maybe it is working for others. But me personally thinks that this game is dangerous and should not be played among neither little kids nor adults.
