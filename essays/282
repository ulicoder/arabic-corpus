Homework assignments is very important topic to focus on. It has many benefits on the student's grade and understanding. First, homework assignment helps the students to remember the materials that he learned in class and by doing that it helps him to make the material stuck in his mind, every time he has homework on the same topic it will benefits him better. According to researches, if you want to remember words you have to read it once at least every day. So it is easier for the student to understand the material better not only studying for the test which is harder.
Second, homeworks helps students to arrange their time, to be more organized. They will know that they have homework to do but on that day they have also basketball game to watch or play, so he by himself star to think how he can do both studying and basketball in the same day. Once the student is older he will have more things to do on the same day so he will be able to manage to do more than one thing at a time, this also will help him in his real life when he is under pressure and has not time to do things but he will success.
Finally, parents should help student to arrange their time at first until hey know how to do that by themself. They don't have to be so kindly with their kids because homework assignments helps students better than nothing to do in their free time.
