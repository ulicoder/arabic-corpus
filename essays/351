Women earned low computer science degrees than males, that due to different reasons. The first one, girls don't see that saving degree is very important rather than marry and have lovely family because she is emotional person in her daily life but males want the best life, they think differently, they want to earn degree in order, to have high socioeconomic status and good attitude in the society. Secondly, most of the women didn't like these subject to study, they go to the beauty word, man didn't do such thing.
On one hand, I agree with statement that girls didn't get their degrees because the society don't encourage them to do it, we can see this in our real life.
On the other hand I disagree that the cultural could be an effective reason who prevent girls to get their degree, because they are a lot of girls who refuse these roles and achieve their dreams.
To conclude, the real reason is: society do not courage the girls to complete their education, they want them just to stay at home to take care of their family.
