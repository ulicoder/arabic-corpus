The numbers of cars at the last period has been increasing significantly, and that causes great problems in different fields in reality, such as traffic accidents, traffic jam, environmental pollution, because of poisonous gases that emitted from motor vehicles, the reason for the high numbers of cars is the increase in population around the world.
On the other hand banning cars may cause huge life difficulties to the per capita especially at this time and that's leads to obstacles in meeting the needs of the person furthermore difficulty moving.
In my opinion the governments should provide alternative solution for population before blocking cars from entering the city center because it is an important that contains the substantial institutions area, so they must provide the citizens an eco friendly cars to preserve nature as well increase the use of public transports so they do not have to expand the streets by cutting trees and use agricultural land, at the end in order to solve the case we must follow a new system and new lifestyle.
