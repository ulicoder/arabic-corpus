"bow- wow theory"
this theory talks about the first words were sounds we make when we feel something
for example: when we say eww, or when we say ouch.
so in my opinion, this theory is makes the most sense because it happens in our daily life.
also we know it the most, we use it the most.
and also because it about something we say when we feel it so it makes a sense because it about feelings that happens to us .
for example, when we get injured we say ouch, or when we feel disgusting we say eww.
another example, when we stand line and it is long we hutt to show a feeling of dissatisfactions.
so we express our feelings by a word that does have a meaning but it is not exactly a word.
so although it is not a word it has a meaning and it help us to express our feelings .
and also instead of to say a long word or a sentence to express our felling we say a short one.
for example, instead of to say it hurts we can say ouch.
or instead of to say it is disgusting we can say eww.
another reason that i think it makes a sense because it helps the kids that can not talk yet.
because they can not talk so how they can express their feeling and also we want to understand them.
so these words can help them.
