No one forgets a good teacher.
Every teacher has a way to teach the students but one of them successes to do this in the right way, and the other not.
The good teacher is the teacher who support his students, and help him to face all the challenges during the study, if that in the treat with the material or in solving homework.
Also the teacher must be patient because when he do that, the students will feel that he is like his father so the kid we like him, and the teacher will passes the material more easier to him.
In my high school there were a teacher who teach me three years, it was amazing person that get in my life, he teach me how to be strong and how I can do things in right way, so it was very good teacher, I can't forget him and I will not forget him all my life. I forget some things that he was call us in the home after school and he was ask us if we want any help not just in homework also in personal issue.
No if I meet him in any places, I just tell him how much I love him and how he was the best teacher I ever meet.
So every teacher must to know how to treat with student because they the basic in life, and they could change his perspective for life.
