Regarding playing the Pokemon Go game, Jeong thinks that playing it is helpful because the player spends time outside that allows him to “discover historical landmarks, parks, statues and street art all around the places Pokemon were hiding”. Whereas, Race states that this game is “detrimental to the developing brain” because it “inhibits the development of key functions of the prefrontal cortex — critical thinking, problem solving, empathy and attention.
The above statements are valid arguments whether the game gives players the chance to discover outside places or it damages the developing of the brain. I tend to think that what is more important in such a game is considering the public place safety. Usually, public places are not safe for all and especially women, so whether you are a female player or a random human standing in the street, the chances for others to attack women is higher. In this case, it will be dangerous for women to play this game unless the public place is safe.
Moreover, it’s unusual to see people wandering in the streets without a real purpose. Especially the elderly will find it awkward to know that a certain human is searching for something that is related to a game. Therefore, I think it would be preferable to allot special areas for such a game that the public space isn’t violated and kept for certain usual purposes.
