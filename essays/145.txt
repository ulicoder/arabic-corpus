Basically, as a teacher, teaching small classes is better than teaching bigger ones. Small classes help the teacher to teach each pupil individually.
I think young students need more attention as well as more time for taking teacher comments.
The ideal size for a school classes are maximum 1-10 pupil. Activities during classes are suitable for small groups teaching. Big classes make teacher more tired and depressed.
