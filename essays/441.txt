The narrator of the article "Filter Bubble" seemed to be a professional in social media and the internet, he reveals and discussed very important issues that we as bloggers or guests are not familiar with. Such as the results of our research interests, the connections of your interests and sites you surf in and how it appears on your new feeds wall.
This article shows the personal interests disappear, the time you look for something on the internet, it becomes obvious to others; companies and sites. As bloggers that surf inside different websites, we are not aware of this danger that we involve in. For example, Google tries to attract the surfers by representing in front of them their interests, which this the politics of gaining their businesses money.
The interesting thing is that the writer criticizes these politics without limitation, he expands the readers' knowledge about the filter bubble. It is more complicated than what we know. We think that we surf safely, however, the filter bubble does affect our life by impact our ability for choosing the way of living. When you enter the filter bubble, you give the companies the chance to enter into your world. The personalization will lead you down a road to a kind of informational determinism in which the web history will automatically determine to you the results of searching according to your choices.
I can understand how Facebook politics work. Since a huge percentage of users are businessmen, famous companies and political advertisements; their purpose is to attract this kind of users more than people with personal accounts. So they care about them more, they rush to represent their interests.
As a result, sometimes we become victims and fall between these two worlds, we face irrelevant news for us and we miss the most significant moments of family, friends or maybe groups we joined, which is really annoying for me as a part of this web.
