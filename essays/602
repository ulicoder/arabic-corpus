To begin with, the aim of our presentation was to discuss the "The Tell-Tale Heart" with the audience and me and my partner did that trough gradual steps. Firstly, we introduced the topic by a background information about the author, and then continued to discuss the characters, the setting, themes, and quotes and so onâ€¦
Aside from the Power Point Presentation that we used as a visual aid to help us present and highlight the topics and the important ideas, we applied a visual act as well. The act was about an exclusive play in which performed in as the protagonist and my partner as the narrator. What was mostly important about the activity is that it guaranteed a maximum concentration from the students` side; also, it reflected the plot of story. Moreover, when we picked up volunteers it evoked a lot the students` sensation of participating in the events and in their learning process.
Mostly important was that we went through all the components together that we were supposed to cover during the presentation as it had been planned. In addition, we tried as much as we could to make the students think and not just to pure the knowledge on them like empty vessels that are waiting to be filled with as Socratic says. The student`s brains are activated by different questions and topics that we discussed with them for instance the brain storming about the quotes.
All in all, I believe that I presented very well and honestly I see that I would not have changed anything in the way I did things in our case here, however, I maybe need to work on making my speaking clearer by rising my voice or slowing down a bit while talking.
