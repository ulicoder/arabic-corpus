The use of social media has controlled the human being life. Many people use different types of social media to document their everyday life activities. One of the most popular applications is Instagram where people can easily download their pictures, add the place / event they are in and the friends they are with.
I personally, use Instagram almost every day, yet, I'm not one of those who are downloading every single picture they take during the day.
However, many people around me do use Instagram and put too much energy into the way they depict their lives through photos. In this regard, Sheldon and Bryant (2016) "found that the amount of time spent editing photos for Instagram was significantly correlated with the level of narcissism." In other words, spending too much time staring in your photo trying to edit it gradually become an addiction.
Furthermore, Dion (2016) states that people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started experiencing a decline in life satisfaction.
