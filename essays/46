Some studies found that school students perform better when the classes start later. Therefore, some people believe that schools should adjust the starting time of their lessons so that students can get more sleep in the morning. Personally, I disagree with this theory. I believe that students will still not get enough sleep, even if the school started later. The problem is the time that the students go to sleep in, not the time that they wake up in. Thus, I believe that school starting hours should remain the same.
