Young people enjoy life more than older people do: I disagree this statement because I think that it is not true, and that’s for many reasons that support my opinion.
Firstly, every level of our life has it feature, so we can't say that the older people don’t enjoy their life, sometimes it seems to us that they don’t, but in fact they do. If you ask your grandparents about their opinion, they will say that’s was a great period in the young but know also they feel good.
Also in this age they have more experience in the life, because they face many problems and challenges so, now they can help us when we need some advances from them, they feel proud about their self and enjoy the fact that we ask them and listen to them. For example, when I go to my grandmother she starts to tell me about her adventures, what she did, how it was then I see in her eyes how she proud about herself, also proud because she arrives to this point.
People when become older that’s mean this is the time to rest and relax, in order to enjoy their life because in the past they worked hard and try to build their future, moreover there are many activities to do like: to meet their old friends and to have fun time with them, join to different clubs, go to play distress, watch films in the cinema and the most important thing is to develop hobby that they have already, but they couldn’t do it because concerns of life.
In addition, when you become older and see your family, your sons, grandchildren. when they come to you and play with you, chatting also do activities together so will how they happy, in this cases you will be proud about what you have did.
Finally, because of this reasons I disagree that older people enjoy less in their life.
