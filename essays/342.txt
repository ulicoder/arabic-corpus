The use of technology in teaching have been a subject of debate in the past few years. The idea of using computer tablets is one of the aspects in which the supporting bodies of the use of technology in the classrooms are trying to advocate for it.
On the one hand, the use of tables can be beneficial to boast the students interest and motivation to learn, as according to a study by Singer and Alexander, school students enjoyed the use of tablet, however, the same study concludes that the students learned better when they used print textbooks, which portrays that despite the students' excitement for the better of their learning, tablets are not the answer. On the other hand, computer tablets can be of a positive impact on the student learning, as according to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2011) students using tablet computers saw their math test scores increase by 20% in one year compared to student using traditional textbook, which highlight an appealing effect of the use of tablets.
In conclusion, the use of tablet computers has its positive and negative sides, and considering the fields in which it may be beneficial and using them for it, while sticking to textbooks where it does not bring the desired outcome, would be the ideal direction.
