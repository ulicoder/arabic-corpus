I believe that the human start to talk by signs, especially in the stone stage, so they
start to explain about themselves by using the signs , and in my opinion it is
really could work, and i believe that the sign language is an important part of
the language itself, because we do need the signs even when we speak normally.
After this period the human beings start to detect that they can use their phonological
system in order to acquire a words and speak loudly to express about their
feelings. maybe at the beginning they start to imitate each other until they
become fluent and be able to acquire a wholeÂ  system of language which
consists of letters and words and these words can acquire complete clear
sentence . after they acquire a language the start to transfer the languages by
cultures that they start to speak with the child and then when the child become
young he can communicate with a conversation this thing happens with human
beings and different culture and country has a different system of language. to
summarize my idea i think that the bow-wow theory is the effective one between
them because human being in the past start to hear a sounds around them like a
sound of cat and dog and another animals and they think that they also can
produce a sound like them and step by step they discovered that they have a phonologica system can and they can produce words and complete sentences .
