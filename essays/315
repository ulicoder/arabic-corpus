According to Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor supports the idea that women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in US.
The Big Bang Theory is a famous series where the main character Sheldon is a male and a nerd and all of his friends were all in the field of computer science. This shows how the television has a major impact on young girls minds choosing and pursuing a degree.
In addition, a personal experience back at high school with a biotechnology major, I studied harder than my male classmate and in the end we still got the same grades, this shows why I found myself not good enough for pursuing a degree at computer science.
