I agree with the statement that mentioned above, that a teachers ability to relate with students well more important that the materials and knowledge that she give at her lessons.
Think there's two types of teachers, the first one who just attend the class, giving the materials letting the students writes down and when he finished the lesson he gets out, without asking if they understood or if there's something they find it really hard to understand. And the other type is that teacher who cares for every details and everything that happens at her class, she's not focusing just on the materials, she cares about her students feeling about their thoughts about the class and so on. From my experience at school I was more into the other type of teacher that cares about everything, because if you couldn't be friends with your students you will not get anything from them just like they will hates you and hates your lessons as well; also they will not make any effort in order to succeed at your lesson, so being close with the students helps you to pay their attention at the class. when you get into the class don't see yourself just as a teacher but a friend with border for sure.
To sum up, I think that being a friend with your students will helps you a lot to be a successful teacher because if the students succeed that means you succeed too as a teacher so being the first type of teacher that I have mentioned before will not helps you at all.
