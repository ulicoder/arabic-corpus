I don't agree to give the pupils the opportunity to evaluate their teachers, especially, if it is an intermediate school.
Pupils in fifth or sixth grade are not aware enough of the way in which teachers are evaluated. They begin to think of a teacher personally depending on their own point of view. they try to do this without taking into a consideration the level of the teach and the way she presents the material. For example, in the survey that we had for our pupils last year, we found that the results were not reflected.
Most of students answered that teachers are very violent and they don't care about the pupils, which is not correct at all.
Therefore, I would never agree to let the pupils evaluate their teachers.
