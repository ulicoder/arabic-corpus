At the end of each year, many schools ask their students to evaluate their teachers. Yet, this debate has been put into focus recently. Students should have voice at schools and express their opinions and thoughts, in order to influence their educational process.
Although many educators believe that students should not be allowed to evaluate, because they are not mature enough for highly critical evaluations. Thus, the result of their highs and lows, and they're filled with emotions, and that they don't understand the importance of hard work, and discipline.
In addition, educators believe that students who are given low grades will, is expected to receive low and bad evaluation, and vice versa for good students. This is the result of their unreasonable evaluation.
However, student deserve to have a voice, and to share their opinions with the teachers and school.
The connection between teachers and students in class is very essential, and the teacher's performance in class and his way of teaching depends on how the students see him, and how his teaching style effect them, and teachers may not notice these things, only the students can. Therefore it is good to give students to evaluate, because it can help teachers to improve their teaching skill. What they should or better do, what they should ignore. Their feedback can be really helpful for them. In my opinion, I believe student should have a voice, and be given the opportunity to evaluate the same as teachers, because it can help both to see their teaching skills, and their development in educational process.
