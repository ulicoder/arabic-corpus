I believe that teaching English should be in small groups. It should not be more that 8-10 pupil in each group.
Besides, the groups should be divided into the students' levels. I do believe that since each student has the right to have the chance to participate, as, answer, and express more than in a big one which includes about 30 pupils.
Moreover, it is easier for the teacher to control the class and keep it quiet.
