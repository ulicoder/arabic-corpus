Textbooks vs. tablets is one of the biggest issues in our recent lives. A lot of discussions have been going on recently about taking our textbooks and integrating tablets instead at schools.
Technology has invaded our everyday life and has become an important part of daily life. Children use their computers, tablets and cellphones daily, so why not also at school.
According to a study by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2011, it showed that students got higher grades after one year of using tablets instead of textbooks in their learning style.
This shows that the students achievement is better than when using textbooks.
When using technological devices at school, teachers can be more accurate about the information given and can always update it. It also gives the students to practice their computer skills. However, there are also who are against the idea of having tablets instead of textbooks. According to Singer and Alexander (2016) students found more textbooks more efficient than using tablets because they understood the material better in using printed books.
This finding may have resulted because students are more serious when they are handling a textbook and consider computer for playing not for studying.
The cost is another important factor because not everyone could afford to have a tablet and schools should have access to every students not only those who could afford a tablet.
In my opinion, I believe that textbooks are better to use in my classrooms that tablets because it gives different skills the tablets can't and I like to have eye-contact with my students so they could understand the information more easily.
