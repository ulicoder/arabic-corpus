When I was 13 years old my family and I went to a hotel in Eilat city for one week, in this hotel there is two swimming pools one big park, football and basketball stadium, that was a perfect hotel.
Every day I goes to the swimming pool swim with my brother and goes to walk on Eilat streets, and then get back to the hotel to take a nap and to eat some food. The last day was my best day at the vacation because I went to the sea and swim with a beautiful small and colorful fishes.
That was a happy and nice vacation and I liked it, I want to go there again to recall all the nice memories of Eilat.
