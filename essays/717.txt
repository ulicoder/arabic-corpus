Recently, we notice that many cities have begun banning cars from entering the city center I think this is a good move to the people for many reason:
Firstly, by banning the car from entering the city center that will reduce the car using and also reduce air pollution, this will give us a little bit of fresh air and save our health, by breathing pure air.
Secondly, banning cars enter the city center will Encourage people to walk or to ride a bik to their Destination, that will help them lose some fats and keep there's body clean and athlete, also by walking outdoor human mind become more creative, this maybe be useful for many people.
In conclousion, banning cars from entering the city center is a good decision, and I comletly agree with it.
