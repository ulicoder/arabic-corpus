I think that "pooh-pooh" theory it makes the most sense. This theory says that speech develops through the sounds that people made in the emotional conditions.
The discoverers of this theory believe that speech develops by these natural cries like pain, anger and joy.
We say ouch when we are in painful situations but when we say Ah!, Ooh! when we say it normal we say it with a large amount of air and this shows the joy or fascination of a certain thing.
In short, this theory speaks of the way humans respond to certain situations such as joy and sadness and there are many animals do like this sound too.
In this theory human language originated from emotional exclamations because that i think it makes most sense.
These human reactions eventually evolve into human language, when someone shouts we know that he is pain or when someone laughs know that he/she very happy, these expressions have become as a language used among humans.
The problem in this theory, there are so many expressions that are spoken "pooh-pooh" so that humans do not distinguish between expressions.
For example, there is a difference between how these responses are spoken from country to country or from people to people.
According to this theory there are many heterogeneous words, and these words vary from language to language,for instance, a dog's bark is heard as au au in brazil, ham ham in albania, and wang, wang in China.
So there are many words that are of the same origin but are not derived from the same natural sounds.
