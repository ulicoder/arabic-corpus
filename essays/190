Most people can relate to the great comforts of the air conditioner in summer, that provide a very comfortable climate at stores, workplaces, etc. In some of these place they extremely use the air conditioner. However, this issue has been found to be commonly used for fitting people's surrounding.
The air conditioning has been around for about many years and to a lot of people, it is used to comfort them wherever they exist. Murphy (2015) illustrates that if a person can make the others feel the cold that is a sign of being powerful and prestigious, because many stores owners think that if the colder the air conditioner was, that should maintain their store more power and prestige.
It seems that in contrast of that, many people argue that air conditioner can provide a suitable climate in order to feel good where you exist, because if not, it would cause them to be lacking energy and activity. Hedge and Gaygen (2010) claim that the optimum work temperature is +23-24 Celsius and people are less productive and make more mistakes if the room temperature is lower than that.
