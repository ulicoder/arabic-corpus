Social media became worldwide use to communicate with each other and enables people to keep updated with all the news. According to a study by Dion (2016) found that people who followed many celebrities on Instagram started to experiencing a decline in life satisfaction.
Many people nowadays and in particular teenagers use Instagram to follow their favorite celebrities and keep updated with what do they do and what do they wear and so on. However with time it became an exaggeration and obsession with them. The perfect and wealthy life that celebrities show on social media basically on Instagram influence the people that they follow and in fact they try to imitate them in every way. Moreover, this made them feel bad about themselves and have no satisfaction on their lives. As a result, due to their desire to be just like their celebrity and to be popular or be loved by other actually tuned out to be bad effect on them by experiencing dissatisfaction of their own selves.
Personally, I use Instagram a lot. However, I follow many celebrities to keep updated with their movies / series latest news, not in order to imitate them or to feel unsatisfied about myself. It is a beneficial tool to try to keep updated and actually feel close to our favorite ones.
