Texting has its advantages and disadvantages as well as phone calling. First thing first, texting is much more convenient in fact in which you can text multiple messages at a time where by communicating with all your friends.
Comparing these two ways of communication's apps is very obvious, for instance, calling someone and listening to their voice while speaking would be much more intimate than texting, you can hear a tone in their voice and brings something into conversation in a way that texting cannot. That is one of the phone calling advantages.
Relating to disadvantages of that issue, might be that we cannot take back or repeat what you say. Unlike texting you cannot hit backspace button on the screen. Something we can say the wrong thing, so we have to be more careful on a phone call.
