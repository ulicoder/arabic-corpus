I think this article is the most interesting one because it talks about having a summer job through posting Instagram sponsored. It was very interesting to know that while some teens spent the summer working in different jobs that takes many hours of their daytime, many others were making money through doing sponsored content on Instagram which takes only a while, as one teen said that it is the easiest way to make money without becoming famous on the internet.
However, I think the article that presented the best evidence is "How Influencers Build Instagram Followings" because it is based on interviews and quotes.
