I totally agree with the mixed-sex schools. As a mother, I see that my children should be able to learn with different children. This difference can be in sex, language and nationality.
In my opinion, children can deal well with the outside world situations, if they exposed to others from very young ages.
In addition, mixed-sex school is a good opportunity for both, boys and girls, to be met there. This can help them to explore others well. Getting to know the other sex from very young age makes children ready to have healthy sex relationships in the future. Finally, I believe that mixed schools lead for competitions between the two sexes. This may make children more motivated to learn.
