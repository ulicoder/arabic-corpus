In the recent years, some schools started tablet computers instead of textbook, because they think it is more effective, and students enjoy using them.
According to Singer and Alexander (2016), it is found that school students enjoyed using tables more than print textbooks, but learned better when they used print textbooks. Relating to this study, we can say that text books still considered better than tablet computers in terms of their affect on students' learning.
However, a good learning process could contain both tablet computers and textbooks, in order to get the maximum from the students.
