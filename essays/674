Hello, I want to describe a place I visited recently.
One year ago, I and my friend went to Alanya in Turkey.
We went there because there are many good places and there are many oh high green mountains.
I saw many archeology and I saw the nice beaches of Turkey.
I felt good in this trip because we visited all the places.
I wish to travel again to Alanya because it's a nice city.
