the three articles are interesting for me becuase they are tallking about instagram and almost of us have an account on instagram. I found that the interisting article was that talks about instagram and summer job. I like this article becuase I did not know that when you have a lot of followers you can get money and I think it is interesting for students and teens because they spend most of their time on these accounts. and it is easy because they can study and works in the summer at the same time.
"posting instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" is the most researched and presenting the best evidence because it's based on people experiences.
