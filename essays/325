Cellphones became an essential part of our life. It plays a major role in our everyday activities, for example, we use it to check the weather rather than going outside to see it, we use it to get to a certain destination rather than using a map, we use to play video games and be partners to players from different parts of the world and the list goes on and on.
Pokémon Go for example is a video game that is being used by millions of players around the world, where people go and throw Poke Ball around their area, these balls are not in the real world, which makes the players look like psychos going around the place looking at the ground as if there is something!
Some people like Sarah Jeong a contributing editor at Vice’s Motherboard vertical, states in The New York Times, that Pokémon Go gives her the chance to be outside, be activated and discover new places around her. On the one hand, her claim is rational, but on the other hand, I believe that her time outside could be utilized better if she for instance spend this time with her family or simply enjoy the views around her and seize the moment.
Others like Kristen Race, the author of “Mindful Parenting” and the founder of Mindful Life, claims that the brain of the child while playing Pokémon Go functions the same as when walking an arcade! Therefore, I believe Pokémon Go is just another reason for people to keep staring at their phones, while they could be taking more advantage of the time they are spending looking after unreal things around them.
