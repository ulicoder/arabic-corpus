I would like to describe a nice thing someone did for me. A week ago, I was very sick so I not went to school. As a result, I lost lot from material in school. But, my friend is not leave me alone, she support and helped me in order to return me wasting material. In the beginning I went to her house. The meeting was seriously and I returned all the wasting matters. All this thank to my friend who she is always did a nice things for me. To sum up, I hope that I and my friend to stay together forever, because real friend is always stand with me.
