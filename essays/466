A teacher is a gift, if you think about it being born in a world that has no role models to look up to, the world becomes pointless, that is what a teacher is, it's someone to look up to, someone to respect adore love and learn from.
I graduated three years ago from high school and I could never forget my English teacher, I had an amazing teacher that taught me how to love English, how to respect others through a language, that might sound silly but yes, I owe who I am at the moment and who I want to be to her.
She made me fall in love with the language just by hearing her talk for 45 minutes, her lessons were so enjoyable that I never wanted them to end.
I am going to always appreciate the time that I had with her. And I am proud that I got the chance to even be one of her students. That is how good she was.
The title says: No one forgets a good teacher, and indeed nobody does.
A teacher that devotes her life for her students deserves not to be forgotten.
I guess not many people in our society would see that and that is terribly sad, unfortunately people are busy with money, land, war and religion that they actually forgot who raised them and who taught them, who showed them what is right and what is wrong, but then again not a lot of people get to have an amazing teacher like I did.
I could simply say, I was lucky.
Me being here at the moment says it all already, I want to become a good teacher, want to make a difference in the world, I admit I can't change the world but god. if I could I would.
I'm going to at least appreciate the chance that I have been given, teach how to love, how to respect, how not to hate, how to accept others, how to love books how to enjoy literature, how to simply embrace the world, because once again a teacher is someone to look up to.
