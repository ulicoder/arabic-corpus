Boys benefit a great deal from having girls in the classroom, and there are benefits for both genders. Nevertheless, I suggest that both boys and girls better when they be in separate classes, because single-sex schools are very good because that thing help boys and girls, girls can confidently raise their hands and speak without being made fun of. There will also be less girlfriend - boyfriend nonsense which will stop dating at young age. And teachers will feel less tired in classrooms with girls and boys not together and I believe that girls and boys may learn differently and had good grades and high marks.
