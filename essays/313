Schools should have both sex. Having schools with both boys and girls give the opportunity to the different genders to learn from each other. Learning styles in education differs in both boys and girls. Boys have their own learning style and so is girls, therefore it is better to put them in one classroom so they can learn from each other.
In addition, schools are not meant solely for education. Boys and girls should socialize with each other, make friends and fall in love and experience new things while they are still teenagers and before they enter the grown-up world.
In conclusion, single-sex schools for my opinion is not a good idea for several aspects: the educations and social aspect.
