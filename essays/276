Several articles discuss the ways of evaluation that teachers follow in order to evaluate their students. This paper discusses the opposite, namely students' evaluation of their teachers in terms of their teaching style, helping and understanding the students.
Most school avoid students' evaluation for their teachers. Further, they believe that the fact that they have students who are capable to adapt with their teachers' ways of teaching and perform successfully, it positively reflects the good teaching proficiency of the teacher. Hence, it reflects the students' satisfied and positive evaluation about them.
However, other schools recently prefer to provide the opportunity for their students to evaluate their teachers by filling a reflection from for instance.
These schools claim that students have the right to express their opinions regarding their teachers' methods of style. Moreover, they have the right to criticize them.
From my point of view, this right leads for better outcomes. Since in this way teachers may take into consideration students' evaluation and improve some points. Thus they may help a larger number of students and feel more friendly and comfortable with each other.
