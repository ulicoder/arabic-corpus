A prove to date demonstrates that using the telephone apps on smartphones in order to make phone calls are used less comparing it to other apps. 75% of Millennials prefer texting to calling. This might be because for some talking on the phone is hard, thus, they prefer texting. I can relate to this from my personal experience, due to the fact that I don't use the telephone apps as much as I use the texting ones. Texting seems easier since it is easier to hide behind the texts and craft your responses carefully. There is more time to think and take more risks, in comparison with phone calls which aren't usually done for important matters. Hence, phone calls might suggest variety of disadvantages, when someone uses the phone calling they will have a less of a fitter, and they had to be more serious. In addition talking on the phone might make some people nervous. On the other hand, texting is more fun, it's faster, less serious and less instancy. People aren't always available and they do not have the time to pick up their phones often. Phone calling might be disturbing for some, but when people use texting it feels more appropriate. In my point of view, texting apps are increasing and people tend to use the easier ways to communicate and save their time. Accordingly, I believe that the number of phone calls will be less in the future, in daily situations I see that people use phone calling only for immediate situations. To conclude, texting allows everyone to communicate openly without feeling confused or embarrassed.
