First of all, the subject of "how human languages developed" it is so important.
Because, the languages can help the people to communicate easily.
and in our community in order to fulfill your goals in life you have to contact with other people by different ways, and there are many theories that can help people  to contact with each others and it is like:
1. The natural sound source.
2. The social interaction source.
3. The tool-making source.
4. The physical adaption source and (etc.)
In my opinion, "The tool - making source" makes the most sense. Because, this way can help all the categories.
For example : person who is deaf, this way can help him to communicate with other people because it is depends on "The sign language" and "Gestures: (etc.) .
Moreover, I think that this theory is significant, and we have to learn it and to follow it for a specific reason  :
Indeed, in my work I faced a problem to contact with people who are (deaf).
I worked for two years at a supermarket, and I met with customers who are deaf, and when they wanted to know the prices of the products they were asking me about it, and I was helping them to know the prices by using "The Sign Language", and to use my hands, or to write on a sheets if some of them can read.
However, I really found a difficulties to explains many things to this people, Because I didn't learn the "Sign Language" I just know a little bit of it.
For example: in the supermarket some mistakes could happen, it is like when the cashier want to calculate the totally of the goods, he may do a mistake on the computer. and in this case he has to explain this to the customer in order to understand what exactly happened.
So, this experiment helped me to know why it is so important to learn "The sign language" that can help all the people to communicate with each other.
