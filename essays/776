The fast food is a very important case that the most of the people are debating in. There is a lot of fast food restaurants in the world.
I think that fast food restaurants should be banned in the vicinity of schools because the searchers proved that the fast food is not healthy. The student need to be healthy and to eat just a healthy food because healthy food help them to concentrate well in their lesson. So instead of eating burger and chips that cause to lose their concentration they can eat somethings that more healthier like cheese sandwich and vegetables.
Fast food is one of the biggest reasons that lead to fatness and a lot of body problems like high pressure.
Finally I really think that we have to make a step in a way to keep our children life and to save them from this big danger.
