All-girl schools are becoming more and more popular recently. parents are doing their best to separate their girls from boys, as they believe that it will help their daughters concentrate and achieve higher grades. I do not think that all-girl schools are a good idea and I believe that it should be banned by law.
Separating girls from boys might reduce behavioral issues that cause a mess in mixed classes. However, it has many disadvantages. Firstly, the separation will create a false understanding of reality, since it will prevent girls from dealing with reality. Consequently, girls who study in separated schools will eventually suffer from a lack in social skills, and the normal communication between boys and girls will be harmed.
Secondly, when we separate girls from boys, we teach them not to accept individual differences. In addition, we become overprotective over our girls students and daughters, which will eventually create a gap between them and girls who study alongside boys. This gap can be cultural, social and in some cases, educational.
in conclusion, girls should study in mixed schools and instead of choosing the easy way to separate them from boys, we should teach them how to influence their peers and how to provide for their small community school.
