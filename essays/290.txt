In schools, students opinions are often ignored. Although, students in schools are an important element in schools, but their opinion is ignored by the teachers and the principal.
Students' opinions are most of the time dismissed, which is not good. Teachers have to hear the students' voice in many issues. First, when students are allowed to talk and evaluate their teachers, they will express their opinion which is their right.
Moreover, when students have the chance to evaluate their teachers, this will help them to appreciate their self, and this will assure them that they have value at their schools.
Although, students may use this strategy against a teacher, but it will allow the principal and the people in charge to know what their teachers do and how do they treat students, if they do their duty or not.
So, to conclude, the students' evaluation is an important aspect to use at schools.
