My favorite season of the year is summer. Because of the warm weather the school vacation and the endless fun.
Particularly, in this season, it's warm enough to do everything you can't do in winter. It is the time of activities and travels. Honestly, I cannot get bored on a summer day or night.
One above all, the school is closed for two months. So, I will not get worried if I sleep later or getting up late at afternoon.
Summer is a season of relaxing, having fun and enjoying the time with the family.
