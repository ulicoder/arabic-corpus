Students are considered to be one of the main components of the educational process. Therefore, some people claim that students should be given the chance to evaluate their teachers. However, other people believe that students might be not mature or objective enough to give such a feedback. Personally, I think that students should be given the chance to express their opinions regarding their teachers. Since that students are the subjects the teachers are aiming to benefit, their point of view should matter. The students' reactions, opinions and feedback should be heard and studied because it will eventually affect their learning. It is true that students might be not mature or objective enough to evaluate their teach, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be heard. Students' evaluation can be taken into consideration but not to the point where they are given the power to affect the teacher's position or job. However, if the majority of the students seems to be criticising the same issue over and over again and it seems to crucial, then I believe, other people in position such as the principal should interfere.
As can be seen, I believe that students should be given a voice and heard. However, people in charge should keep in mind the students' mentality.
