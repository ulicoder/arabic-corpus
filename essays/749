Usually I like a place who full of trees and useful air.
I love to live like these place, like America and Europe because I'm person who love the trees and quietly also useful air and that mean "reef".
Ok, I like the parties and nights lives but not all the time, it make me angry and nervous sometimes.
I love to live like this places to play around the trees and go to walk inside the reef that make me so happy. The trees give me unbelieve energy.
Here in Israel so hard to find like these places so I hope to go far from here and a live in America give you a chance to make your English language better than now.
So I hope to live in this place in future.
