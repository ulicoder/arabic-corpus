A good teacher believes in her/his students.
I think that if you want to be a teacher you should believe in yourself and your ability to teach your students and make sure to give them the right education.
You should believe in your students, be patient with them and inspire them.
The good teacher is the one who should be kindly and friendly to his students so they will love him and then love the topic.
The teacher should be good example for his students and make them believe that they can do it they can success at the end.
If the teacher was a good leader the students will be able to success and believe in there self, more than if the teacher was just want to pass time without any benefit and any attention.
Some of teachers do not have an idea how to deal with students so they get fail and lose hope to complete learning in the right way.
In generally I want to become a teacher and I chose to be an English teacher because I love this topic, so I will make my students love it too by many ways in my mind.
I want to perfection the students in English because I found that most of the students in my school, find it difficult to speak and learn this language.
Every student can be success even if some of them has difficulties in English, teachers should help each one of them by give them hope and encourage them to study in the right way.
There is too many ways to make your student study in the right way, like give him information about how to study in general.
At the end I think that the good teacher who believe in his student and care about them, is the original and at the summit of everything.
