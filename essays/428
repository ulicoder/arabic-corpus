The three articles were interesting because they talked about a trend which is widespread in our daily life, I found the first one  the most intersting "Posting instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" because it talks about teens that they spend a lot of time on working in different jobs while others are "working" by recieving a large number of followers on Instagram then they earn money from this system. I think "Posting instagram sponsored content is the new summer job" is  the most researched and presenting the best evidence because it's based on peoples' experiences.
