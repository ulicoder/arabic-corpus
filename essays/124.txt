I do not recommend getting a driving license at the age of 16. Teenagers at this age are very hasty and irresponsible. These young drivers can endanger their lives on the street. Also, that might harm other innocent drivers indirectly. Teenagers at the age of 16-17 are not psychologically stable. Also, their bodies go through many physical changes. these factors affect their quality of driving negatively.
Personally, I think that the best age for getting a driving license is 18. At this age, the teenagers are much calmer. Also, they are more responsible for their actions. Moreover, they have much time to concentrate on their driving than before. That is because they have less educational duties and exams at this stage of life.
