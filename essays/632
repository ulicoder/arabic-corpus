This presentation experience was somehow a challenge for me because I was kind of “forced” to work with a colleague with the fact that I can not really work in a group because it is hard for me to rely on other people, so that I had to adapt.
The working process: at the beginning I was worried that my mate would be irresponsible and lazy like the rest of the class but it wasn’t really that bad because she did do her best with me she had her parts and I had mine; we were working together spontaneously, also we both could understand each other.
The presentation: I was way too excited to present that I forgot a lot of information to say even though I had notes (and that was the worst part) but all in all I felt confident while presenting because I learnt the story by heart because I really loved it so I was speaking spontaneously but on the other hand, the class is kind of boring presenting was like speaking to the wall somehow because most of them were on their phones and not paying attention, later on when we started with the activity some of the students were making fun of others when they answered and that was disrespectful. In the presentation I felt that I’ve messed some things up yet I was grateful of the teacher’s feedback.
