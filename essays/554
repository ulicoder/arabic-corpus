As teachers we have a responsibility towards our students because our job is to give the generations we're teaching the right amount of love, care and knowledge, but the question is; which one is more important than the other, is it the ability to relate to your students or to know more about the subject you're teaching.
On the one hand, without having the knowledge of the subject being taught you can't teach it, so we do understand that it's essential to the proses of teaching, on the other hand, knowledge on its own can't do much, the teacher needs to always remember that these students are human beings and they need to be related to, I believe that a teacher must find a way to do that, because even if you donâ€™t have excellent knowledge but you do have a way of delivering the knowledge you have to students then by the time they will leave your class they would have gained enough information and more important they would remember everything they have learned because they felt connected to the teacher.
