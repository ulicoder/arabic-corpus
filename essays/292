Some people prefer phone calls when they want to talk with someone, but others prefer texting.
Although texting is easier, quicker and less personal than calling, but me personally prefer texting than calling.
When a person needs to know something no matter how important it is, when he sent a message, the other person may not receive the message for different reasons.
But, when you send a message, you will have a chance to delete, change and organize the message.
To conclude, both texting and calling are helpful but it depends on the situation.
