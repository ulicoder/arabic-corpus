In my opinion, I think that people should be allowed to drive a car at the age of 18.
I think so because they will be more aware, balance and responsible rather than excited and deteriorated.
In addition, driving a car isn't an easy thing. It requires a high level of vigilance. Many people were killed by 16 teenager who drive their cars speedily.
