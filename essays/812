The genetic source: babies are born with an innate capacity for language acquisition (start learning even before birth).
I believe that this is the most convincing theory about the human language develop because I've heard about a lot of studies that says babies in their mother's womb can hear stuff after a couple of months and they can feel also things around them (out of the womb) so these informations support the theory in my opinion and the Importance of saying the words pronunciation in the right way because babies are capable of absorbing informations quickly.
and i also read once that  even if your mother's tongue is Arabic for example and you start speaking with your child English all the time the mother tongue for them would be English so you can't confuse  your baby's mind by talking with him different languages.
so the language acquisition that the babies have, we must take advantage of this capability  and use it in the right way so they can grow even in their mother's womb with the most effective thoughts and powerful mind.
so whenever we say some words in incorrect way just for fun and to play with baby -it's a very common habit-  it's not acceptable because these words would stock in the baby's mind and they would have future difficulties in pronunciation.
