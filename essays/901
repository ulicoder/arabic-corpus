When I started my first degree, I thought that I would finish my degree and would be employed, but no. I graduated on 2011, I have been working as a substituted teacher for four years. I love teaching English and I enjoy teaching so I decided that I will not give up easily and I will continue to the second degree in English. Other important reasons of entering the M.A. program are refreshing my English, receiving knowledge, I believe knowledge is power. Entering the M.A. program is a big dream comes true.
My goals now are not only to find a work, but to graduated in high grades and to continue to other degrees. My expectations are to finish my second degree with high grades and to receive as much as I can knowledge.
