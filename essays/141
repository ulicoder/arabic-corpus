I think teenagers should not be allowed to drive until the age of 18. before that, teens should concerns about their studies and grades at school.
Teenagers under the age of eighteens are not aware of their behaviors. Moreover, I don't look at them as adults. In my opinion, driving a car can risk other's live. So, teenagers should care of the responsibility for saving people lives.
