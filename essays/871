Instagram is one of the most popular social networks. It has lots of followers all over the world. As a teacher and a mother for a teenage girl, I believe that youngsters use it much more than adults who are above 40. These youngsters were born in a wold of technology and for them this kind of technology is one of the spinal cords of their lives.
It is very important to me as a person to keep my personal life as private as possible. Our lives should not be spread over any social network. There is nothing wrong with posting some pictures ever now and then, but sometimes sharing personal photos can become an obsession to some people. According to Sheldon and Bryant (2016) people who spend a lot of time posting photos for Instagram were connected to a significant level of narcissism.
Youngsters also follow their favorite celebrities on Instagram. Adults may not see this as a negative thing. Sometimes even adults may be anxious to know more about these celebrities. It is in our human nature to want to know more about other peoples' lives. However, a study conducted by Dion (2016) showed that followers of celebrities' lives on Instagram may suffer from dissatisfaction in their own lives.
There is no doubt in my mind that Instagram is fun. However the negative impact it has on people should be monitored and eventually controlled.
