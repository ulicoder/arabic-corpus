Singles-sex schools idea is widespread in certain countries, especially in the Middle East. This type of schools became more popular in recent years since many people believe that their children achieve better grades in these schools, as a result of not having competitions and not being intimidated by the other sex.
However, these type of schools have a very serious disadvantage that people may don't take into consideration while their children are still at school. This disadvantage, is that the girls who have been taught in such schools, will not be ready to be involved in the community after they finish school. When these girls register for academic institutions or even when they want to get any job, they will be forced to face and to deal with people from the two genders. This will be hard for the girls who have been graduated from single-sex schools. These girls will find an intensified difficulty to be familiarized with an environment that includes people from the two genders, so they supposedly, will be less successful in academic institutions and in work.
Finally, single-sex schools may be beneficial for the students but for a short phase of their life. This type of schools deprive their students from being engaged in life outside school, and from gaining experience that would help them in the future.
