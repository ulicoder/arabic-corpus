I think that if schools in Israel start at 9:00 am instead of 8:00 am, it will be better for teachers, pupils and parents. No one will be under pressure or tired because of not sleeping well. In addition, it will be better for teachers who have little baby that wakes up a lot at night to start at 9:00 am, they will go to their work in a good mode and with a lot of energy. This change will make life easier for all sides even if they finish later.
