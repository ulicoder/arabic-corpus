The teacher's ability to connect to students is something crucial in the field of teaching. Yet, a person could not teach without having a certain level of knowledge about the subject he's teaching. I believe that being knowledgeable about the subject being taught is more crucial than having connection with students for many reasons:
Firstly, even if the teacher could have a good relationship with the students, he will not be able to achieve and attain the knowledge that students need to have at that level. Thus, this will affect the rest of their later education because at a certain level he has not been taught well enough, or received the knowledge he needs at that stage.
Secondly, one of the most important values of a teacher is to educate and teach his students. Then comes the importance of relating to the student in order to make the process of teaching easier and more influential for both sides. So if the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject and did not have a good relation with his student that will not mean that they will not succeed in his class. Yet the students may not enjoy his class.
Lastly, I believe in the role of teachers and how they can effect our society. This cannot be done by only educating and transferring information to the students' mind. So I believe in having a balance between the two aspect of relating to students and conveying knowledge.
To conclude, I would say that I disagree with the statement for the reasons I mentioned up. I do believe in both aspects, yet I think that having a certain level of awareness of the subject a teacher is teaching is more important.
