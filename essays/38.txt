In my opinion, schools should adopt the new suggestions of starting later. Nowadays, more and more students find it hard to wake up early in the morning since they stay up till the late hours of the night. Some of them spend their time playing video games while others spend it watching TV shows and more. Consequently, they find it very tiring to wake up early in the mornings. However, schools should be careful when it comes to changing the starting time, since it might lead to total chaos regarding transportation, school buses and parents who will have to ride their children later to school, and eventually be late for work. In additions, schools should be aware of the consequences of such change. The studying curriculum should be adapted to cover all the material and they should also consider the finishing time and how it would be affected.
